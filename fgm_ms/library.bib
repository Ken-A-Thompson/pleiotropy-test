abstract = {Polyploid plants often occupy different geographic ranges than their diploid progenitors, but the causes of this segregation are poorly understood. Differential competitive abilities of cytotypes across an environmental gradient could be responsible for these observed geographic range differences.Cytotypes of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) are mostly allopatric, and prior research indicates that tetraploids are more physiologically tolerant of water limitation and occupy drier habitats than diploids. We hypothesized that tetraploids are stronger competitors than diploids in soils where water is limited, which allows them to persist in dry habitats while diploids cannot.We grew both cytotypes together in competition under water-limited and well watered conditions. We varied both total plant density and the relative frequency of cytotypes among pots, which allowed us to separate the effects of intra-cytotypic and inter-cytotypic competition.Both diploid and tetraploid plants were smaller in the water-limited treatment than in the well watered treatment. Nevertheless, there were no differences in the relative strength of intra-cytotypic and inter-cytotypic competition experienced by either cytotype across the watering treatments, indicating that diploids and tetraploids had equal competitive abilities in both treatments.Synthesis. Competition for limiting resources is often proposed as a mechanism causing ecological and geographic segregation between diploid and polyploid cytotypes. Our results do not support the hypothesis that tetraploid Chamerion angustifolium plants are stronger competitors than diploids when water is limited. A differential ability to compete for water is likely not responsible for the observed ecological and geographic segregation between cytotypes in this species. Competition may not be a general mechanism that causes segregation between diploid and polyploid cytotypes in nature.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Roads present formidable barriers to dispersal. We examine movements of two highly mobile carnivores across the Ventura Freeway near Los Angeles, one of the busiest highways in the United States. The two species, bobcats and coyotes, can disappear from habitats isolated and fragmented by roads, and their ability to disperse across the Ventura Freeway tests the limits of vertebrates to overcome anthropogenic obstacles. We combine radio-telemetry data and genetically based assignments to identify individuals that have crossed the freeway. Although the freeway is a significant barrier to dispersal, we find that carnivores can cross the freeway and that 5–32{\%} of sampled carnivores crossed over a 7-year period. However, despite moderate levels of migration, populations on either side of the freeway are genetically differentiated, and coalescent modelling shows their genetic isolation is consistent with a migration fraction less than 0.5{\%} per generation. These results imply that individuals that cross the freeway rarely reproduce. Highways and development impose artificial home range boundaries on territorial and reproductive individuals and hence decrease genetically effective migration. Further, territory pile-up at freeway boundaries may decrease reproductive opportunities for dispersing individuals that do manage to cross. Consequently, freeways are filters favouring dispersing individuals that add to the migration rate but little to gene flow. Our results demonstrate that freeways can restrict gene flow even in wide-ranging species and suggest that for territorial animals, migration levels across anthropogenic barriers need to be an order of magnitude larger than commonly assumed to counteract genetic differentiation.},

abstract = {The "lock and key" hypothesis of mechanical isolation predicts little if any natural hybridization between genitalically differentiated taxa. Chilean Tatochila mercedis (Eschscholtz) differs from Argentina T. sterodice Staudinger and T. vanvolxemii (Capronnier) in the degree and direction of a twist of the aedeagus. We report data on the genetic bases for these traits and use these data for an analysis of the degree of hybridization and introgression of genitalic traits in contact zones in the field. The direction of twist is based on one or a few genes, whereas the degree of twist is probably polygenic; the two characters are statistically independent in the laboratory. The ease of laboratory pairing and the high incidence of hybridization in nature clearly indicate that mechanical isolation based on these traits is untenable. There is a lack of strict concordance of clines involving these characters in the field introgression of twist direction occurs farther eastward than twist degree, but this is a largely consequence of the different genetic bases for these traits. We reject the lock and key model for this group and suggest that arthropod systematists be cautious in recognizing species based on simple genitalic characters in parapatry.},

abstract = {We analyse the genetic variability in the yellow- necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) population in the city of Warsaw, Poland, and its surroundings - a species that has begun to occupy the city only in the last 30 years.We also compare the genetic variability of this species with corresponding data col- lected in the same time and areas for another species - the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius). The results indicate a gradual decrease in genetic diversity and increase in related- ness in the population of A. flavicollis from non-urban locations towards sites with the highest anthropopressure. The genetic structure was more pronounced in the 'recent invader' (A. flavicollis) than in the 'permanent inhabitant' (A. agrarius), which has a much longer city colonization history (more than 100 years). In general, FSTwas higher in A. flavicollis,which may indicate different and independent ways of city coloniza- tion by the species. The process by which urban areas are set- tled by a new, typically forest-dwelling species such as A. flavicollis, more 'sensitive' to the conditions of life in a city, probably includes not only successful events of penetration of the city by small groups of individuals (the founder effect), but also temporary extinctions of local urban populations of A. flavicollis or at least marked fluctuations in species popula- tion numbers. Suitably planned areas at the city borders could play an important role as 'gateways' through which individuals from non-urban populations couldmigrate into the city and join urban populations},

abstract = {Premating reproductive isolation is a strong barrier to hybridization in natural populations, but little is known about the genetic mechanisms that allow changes in mating signals to develop and whether different components of a mating signal can evolve in concert when sexual selection favors phenotypic associations between them. In this study, we report results suggesting that changes in a behavioural trait (courtship display) and multiple phenotypically associated morphological traits (dorsal fin characters and length of the gonopodium) have contributed to divergence in mating signals used by sailfin mollies. Through the use of reciprocal F1 and backcross hybrids, we show that morphological traits important in separating sailfin from shortfin molly species have a genetic basis and are inherited in an autosomal, additive manner. We also report significant associations between the size of certain morphological traits (length of the dorsal fin and length of the gonopodium) and the tendency of males to perform courtship displays or gonopodial thrusts. In particular, higher courtship display rates were associated with increased dorsal fin length but decreased gonopodium length, characteristics most similar to sailfin species. Such phenotypic associations between different components of a mating signal suggest that selective forces can act in concert on multiple aspects of the signal, hence, promoting divergence and speciation in sailfin mollies.},

abstract = {Bryophytes seem particularly suitable to investigate genetic diversity in relation to habitat disturbance due to their large employment as bioindicators and to the recent application of molecular markers to moss population studies. Genetic variation and structure were analysed in seven urban, extraurban and remote populations of Leptodon smithii, an epiphytic moss of Quercus ilex, a phanerogamic species of Mediterranean climax vegetation. A total of 210 individual shoots were DNA extracted and amplified with internal simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers, and 54 haplotypes were identified. An uneven distribution of haplotype number and frequencies was observed among sites, with a higher number of haplotypes and more homogeneous haplotype frequencies in the extraurban/remote populations. Molecular diversity indices were overall higher in the extraurban sites than in the urban ones. Multilocus linkage disequilibrium values were in line with the occurrence of sexual/asexual reproduction in the seven populations. The isolation-by-distance model was not supported by Mantel test among sites; however, within-population fixation index (F-ST) highlighted a clear relation between genetic and physic distances among trees, suggesting a limited dispersal range for L. smithii's spores. The genetic structure was mainly affected by population size, wood structure and extent, and genetic drift consequent to habitat fragmentation and human-induced disturbance.},

@article{Holzman2007,
abstract = {During aquatic suction feeding, the predator opens its mouth and rapidly expands its buccal cavity, generating a flow field external to the mouth. The rapid expansion of the buccal cavity produces high fluid velocities and accelerations that extend only a short distance from the mouth (about half of one mouth diameter), and only persist for several milliseconds. Therefore, the predator must precisely time its strike to locate the prey within the narrow region of high flow, during the brief period when flow is at its peak. With flow being the agent for transferring force to the prey, the predator may enhance these forces by producing higher water velocities and faster acceleration at the mouth, but also through increasing the strike's accuracy, i.e. locating the prey closer to the mouth at the instant of peak flow speed. The objectives of this study were to directly measure forces exerted by bluegill Lepomis macrochirus on their prey and to determine how bluegill modify force output. Bluegill were offered ghost shrimp tethered to a load cell that recorded force at 5000 Hz, and feeding sequences were synchronously recorded using 500 Hz video. Peak forces exerted on attached 20 mm shrimp ranged from 0.005 N to 0.506 N. In accordance with the short duration of the strikes (average time to peak gape of approximately 13 ms), the forces recorded were brief (approximately 12 ms from initiation to peak force), and force magnitude declined rapidly after peak force. Statistical analysis indicated that rate of buccal expansion, and prey size, but not strike initiation distance, significantly affected peak force. These observed variables were used with results from flow visualization studies to estimate the flow at the prey's location, which allowed the calculation of drag, pressure gradient force and acceleration reaction force. The relationship between these calculated forces and the measured forces was strong, indicating that the model can be used to estimate forces from strike kinematics. This model was then used to study the effects of strike initiation distance on peak force and on the rate of increasing force. Comparisons of model output to empirical results indicated that bluegill time their strike so as to exert an average of approximately 70{\%} of the peak possible force on the prey, and that the observed strike initiation distance corresponded to the distance that maximized modeled force on an attached prey. Our results highlight the ability of bluegill to produce high forces on their prey, and indicate that precision and visual acuity play important roles in prey acquisition, beyond their recognized role in prey detection.},

The surface and subterranean populations were genetically distinct, with no evidence of gene flow between closely adjacent populations of the different forms, whereas there was little differentiation between the different populations of each form. The substantially reduced heterozygosity in the Underground populations and the allelic composition suggest that colonization of the Underground has occurred once or very few times. Breeding experiments show compatibility between the Underground populations but not with those breeding above ground. There is evidence of greater gene flow and a mixing of molestus and pipiens traits in the south of the species range. This paper considers the processes that may allow establishment of reproductive isolation in the north of the species range but not in the south.},

abstract = {Rapid and inexpensive sequencing technologies are making it possible to collect whole genome sequence data on multiple individuals from a population. This type of data can be used to quickly identify genes that control important ecological and evolutionary phenotypes by finding the targets of adaptive natural selection, and we therefore refer to such approaches as "reverse ecology." To quantify the power gained in detecting positive selection using population genomic data, we compare three statistical methods for identifying targets of selection: the McDonald-Kreitman test, the mkprf method, and a likelihood implementation for detecting d(N)/d(S) {\textgreater} 1. Because the first two methods use polymorphism data we expect them to have more power to detect selection. However, when applied to population genomic datasets from human, fly, and yeast, the tests using polymorphism data were actually weaker in two of the three datasets. We explore reasons why the simpler comparative method has identified more genes under selection, and suggest that the different methods may really be detecting different signals from the same sequence data. Finally, we find several statistical anomalies associated with the mkprf method, including an almost linear dependence between the number of positively selected genes identified and the prior distributions used. We conclude that interpreting the results produced by this method should be done with some caution.},

For them, analysis in terms of the "relative operating characteristic" of signal detection theory provides a precise and valid measure of diagnostic accuracy.

Representative values of this measure are reported here for systems in medical imaging, materials testing, weather forecasting, information retrieval, polygraph lie detection, and aptitude testing. Though the measure itself is sound, the values obtained from tests of diagnostic systems often require qualification because the test data on which they are based are of unsure quality. A common set of problems in testing is faced in all fields. How well these problems are handled, or can be handled in a given field, determines the degree of confidence that can be placed in a measured value of accuracy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Speciation is often described as a continuous dynamic process, expressed by different magnitudes of reproductive isolation (RI) among groups in different levels of divergence. Studying intraspecific partial RI can shed light on mechanisms underlying processes of population divergence. Intraspecific divergence can be driven by spatially stochastic accumulation of genetic differences following reduced gene flow, resulting in increased RI with increased geographical distance, or by local adaptation, resulting in increased RI with environmental difference. METHODS We tested for RI as a function of both geographical distance and ecological differentiation in Iris atropurpurea, an endemic Israeli coastal plant. We crossed plants in the Netanya Iris Reserve population with plants from 14 populations across the species' full distribution, and calculated RI and reproductive success based on fruit set, seed set and fraction of seed viability. KEY RESULTS We found that total RI was not significantly associated with geographical distance, but significantly increased with ecological distance. Similarly, reproductive success of the crosses, estimated while controlling for the dependency of each component on the previous stage, significantly reduced with increased ecological distance. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the rise of post-pollination reproductive barriers in I. atropurpurea is more affected by ecological differentiation between populations than by geographical distance, supporting the hypothesis that ecological differentiation is predominant over isolation by distance and by reduced gene flow in this species. These findings also affect conservation management, such as genetic rescue, in the highly fragmented and endangered I. atropurpurea.},

abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) has proven to be a useful source of characters for phylogenetic studies in many angiosperm families. The two spacers of this region, ITS-1 and ITS-2 (each {\textless}300 bp), can be readily amplified by PCR and sequenced using universal primers, even from DNAs of herbarium specimens. Despite high copy numbers of both spacers, the near uniformity of ITS paralogues, attributed to rapid concerted evolution, allows direct sequencing of pooled PCR products in many species. Divergent paralogues, where detected, require cloning, but may offer a means of obtaining multiple estimates of organismal relationships and of determining placement of the root in a phylogeny independent of outgroup considerations. In reported studies, variation between ITS sequences is mostly attributable to point mutations. A relatively minor proportion of sites is affected by insertions or deletions (indels) among sequences that are similar enough to have retained sufficient signal for phylogenetic analysis. Within these limits, sequence alignment is generally unambiguous except in small regions of apparently lower structural constraint. Phylogenetic analyses of combined data sets from both spacers, where examined, yield trees with greater resolution and internal support than analyses based on either spacer alone. This beneficial effect of simultaneous analysis is not surprising based on the low number of useful characters in each spacer. This effect also suggests high complementarity of spacer data, in accord with similarity in size, sequence variability, and G + C content of ITS-1 and ITS-2 in most investigated groups of closely related angiosperms. Nonindependent evolution of ITS sites involved in intraspacer RNA base-pairing may occur, given possible functional constraints, but preliminary secondary structure analyses of ITS-2 in Calycadenia (Asteraceae) show no definite evidence of compensatory spacer mutations. As expected, levels of ITS sequence variation suitable for phylogenetic analysis are found at various taxonomic levels within families, depending on the lineage. The apparent rates of ITS molecular evolution are roughly correlated with plant life-form, as with chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) data, but reasons for this observation are unclear. ITS characters have improved our understanding of angiosperm phylogeny in several groups by (1) corroborating earlier unexpected findings, (2) resolving conflicts between other data sets, (3) improving resolution of species relationships, or (4) providing direct evidence of reticulate evolution. Hybridization or sorting of ancestral polymorphism in a lineage can complicate interpretation of trees based on any type of evolutionary evidence, including ITS or cpDNA sequences, particularly in the absence of at least one independent phylogenetic data set from the same organisms. The need for phylogenetic markers from the nuclear genome, to complement the rapidly growing body of cpDNA data, makes the ITS region a particularly valuable resource for plant systematists.},

abstract = {Results from two experiments are presented that contrast differences in life-history traits and population dynamics between two species of live bearing fishes (Gambusia affinis and G. holbrooki) that hybridize across portions of the southeastern United States. Progeny from parental holbrooki and holbrooki-affinis F1 crosses exhibited larger lengths at birth, at 15 days, and matured earlier, and at larger size than did progeny from parental affinis and affinis-holbrooki F1 crosses. Comparisons of experimental populations of affinis, holbrooki, and mixed (affinis + holbrooki) species composition followed over two years revealed that affinis populations consistently exhibited smaller population size, lower carrying capacity, lower recruitment, and larger over-winter mortality than did holbrooki or mixed populations. Evidence for density-dependent reductions in fecundity and concomitant increases in juvenile mortality rates were observed in all populations, but were most pronounced for affinis populations. Genotype-specific differences in life-history traits appear to confer differential advantage to offspring of parental holbrooki origin and F1 progeny of holbrooki maternal parentage given the resource availability and the age structure and densities experienced during these experiments. Results have direct implications regarding the rate and direction of evolution within hybrid zones formed by these two species.},

abstract = {To what degree is the divergent adaptation responsible for life's phenotypic variety also responsible for generating the millions of species that manifest this variation? Theory predicts that ecological divergence among populations should promote reproductive isolation, and recent empirical studies provide support for this hypothesis in a limited number of specific taxa. However, the essential question of whether ecology plays a truly general role in speciation has yet to be systematically evaluated. Here we address this integral issue using an approach that adds an ecological dimension to comparative studies investigating the relationship between reproductive isolation and divergence time. Specifically, we quantify ecological divergence for {\textgreater}500 species pairs from eight plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate taxa and statistically isolate its association with reproductive isolation. This approach demonstrates a highly consistent and significant positive association between ecological divergence and reproductive isolation across taxa. This relationship was also observed across different aspects of ecological divergence and components of reproductive isolation. These findings are highly consistent with the hypothesis that ecological adaptation plays a fundamental and taxonomically general role in promoting reproductive isolation and speciation.},

abstract = {Independently evolving populations may adapt to similar selection pressures via different genetic changes. The interactions between such changes, such as in a hybrid individual, can inform us about what course adaptation may follow and allow us to determine whether gene flow would be facilitated or hampered following secondary contact. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to measure the genetic interactions between first-step mutations that independently evolved in the same biosynthetic pathway following exposure to the fungicide nystatin. We found that genetic interactions are prevalent and predominantly negative, with the majority of mutations causing lower growth when combined in a double mutant than when alone as a single mutant (sign epistasis). The prevalence of sign epistasis is surprising given the small number of mutations tested and runs counter to expectations for mutations arising in a single biosynthetic pathway in the face of a simple selective pressure. Furthermore, in one third of pairwise interactions, the double mutant grew less well than either single mutant (reciprocal sign epistasis). The observation of reciprocal sign epistasis among these first adaptive mutations arising in the same genetic background indicates that partial postzygotic reproductive isolation could evolve rapidly between populations under similar selective pressures, even with only a single genetic change in each. The nature of the epistatic relationships was sensitive, however, to the level of drug stress in the assay conditions, as many double mutants became fitter than the single mutants at higher concentrations of nystatin. We discuss the implications of these results both for our understanding of epistatic interactions among beneficial mutations in the same biochemical pathway and for speciation.},

This fact, in conjunction with regression analysis, allows estimation and comparison of gender-specific selection acting on floral characters in Asclepias syriaca. Univariate regression analysis indicates statistically significant selection on minute aspects of floral morphology through the male and especially female reproductive pathways. Analyses using multiple regression to correct for overall plant size do not qualitatively change the univariate results. The relatively large number of statistically significant selection gradients suggests active adaptation of floral morphological features to the pollinator fauna. Selection through female function differs significantly from selection on the same trait through male function for four traits, emphasizing an antagonism between genders in hermaphrodites. This antagonism and the absence of selection of the antagonistic traits through net fertility are consistent with an equilibrium quantitative genetic perspective, while greater opportunity for selection through female function is counter to expectations based on Bateman's principle of sexual selection.},

abstract = {Aim The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is a widely used statistic for assessing the discriminatory capacity of species distribution models. Here, I used simulated data to examine the interdependence of the AUC and classical discrimination measures (sensitivity and specificity) derived for the application of a threshold. I shall further exemplify with simulated data the implications of using the AUC to evaluate potential versus realized distribution models. Innovation After applying the threshold that makes sensitivity and specificity equal, a strong relationship between the AUC and these two measures was found. This result is corroborated with real data. On the other hand, the AUC penalizes the models that estimate potential distributions (the regions where the species could survive and reproduce due to the existence of suitable environmental conditions), and favours those that estimate realized distributions (the regions where the species actually lives). Main conclusions Firstly, the independence of the AUC from the threshold selection may be irrelevant in practice. This result also emphasizes the fact that the AUC assumes nothing about the relative costs of errors of omission and commission. However, in most real situations this premise may not be optimal. Measures derived from a contingency table for different cost ratio scenarios, together with the ROC curve, may be more informative than reporting just a single AUC value. Secondly, the AUC is only truly informative when there are true instances of absence available and the objective is the estimation of the realized distribution. When the potential distribution is the goal of the research, the AUC is not an appropriate performance measure because the weight of commission errors is much lower than that of omission errors. -� 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

Removal of half the flowers in each inflorescence had little effect on fruit production but decreased pollinarium removals by half, suggesting that one reason why few flowers mature fruits is that many flowers are produced primarily to enhance male reproduction.

Zool. 28:176-196.--Principal components analysis and linear discriminant function analysis were applied to two data sets comprised of a sample of laboratory-reared hybrid fish, and wild-caught parental samples. For each method, the assumptions required for making statistical inferences and the biological assumptions employed in hybrid studies are reviewed. The degree to which we can expect biological data sets to conform to both types of assumptions is assessed by examination of the two data sets discussed here. The usefulness of each method for hybrid identification, quantification of hybrid variability, and general determination of morphological distance from the suspected parents is evaluated by considering the results of the methods when applied to known hybrids. Evidence is presented for decreased developmental integration in the hybrids. Principal components analysis makes apparent the difference in the branchial baskets of the very similar Notropis spilopterus and N. whipplei, suggesting an ecological separation related to this morphology. The hybrids of both the Notropis and Lepomis cyanellus x L. macrochirus crosses had generally intermediate scores in both analyses, but were not uniformly intermediate, instead graded into the parental phenotypes. In the results of principal components analysis, F1 variability precludes the confident identification of all hybrid individuals as well as any specific identification of F2 and backcross individuals; the majority of hybrids should be identifiable as being of mixed genetic origin. Principal components analysis is demonstrated to be of use in the examination of variation in hybrid fishes. Linear discriminant function analysis as it is presently employed does not appear useful for hybrid analysis, for both practical and theoretical reasons. Discriminant function analysis of samples of known hybrid origin may permit subsequent analysis of suspected hybrids.},

To understand evolvability we therefore need to understand the variational properties of biological organisms. Modularity is a variational property, which has been linked to evolvability. If different characters are able to vary independently, selection will be able to optimize each character separately without interference. But although modularity seems like a good design principle for an evolvable organism, it does not therefore follow that it is the only design that can achieve evolvability. In this essay I analyze the effects of modularity and, more generally, pleiotropy on evolvability. Although, pleiotropy causes interference between the adaptation of different characters, it also increases the variational potential of those characters. The most evolvable genetic architectures may often be those with an intermediate level of integration among characters, and in particular those where pleiotropic effects are variable and able to compensate for each other's constraints. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

DNA barcoding is a molecular tool that uses standardised genetic primers, traditionally the 600- to 800-segments of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I, to classify species. It has become increasingly popular as an efficient way of studying and categorising species to prioritise conservation efforts. A challenge remains, however, in using this information to provide a universally acceptable species concept. Genetic barcoding may focus conservation strategies on populations that have differences in mitochondrial DNA rather than on species. DNA barcodes might also provide potentially useful information about taxa that are relatively well studied-rather than those that require more research. The argument is made that DNA barcoding can provide useful taxonomic data, but should be used with caution to prevent it from being used out of context. DNA barcoding is an increasingly fashionable and novel concept that has generated optimism in enhancing biodiversity assessments-however, this approach should be used in conjunction with other methods for effective conservation efforts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated that genomic incompatibilities work together with ecologically divergent selection to promote and maintain reproductive isolation between incipient species (dwarf and normal) of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis (Mitchill, 1818)). Whitefish spawn in groups with external fertilization, which creates conditions for strong sperm competition. In this study, we asked whether reduced sperm performance in hybrids from whitefish species-pair matings might contribute to postzygotic isolating mechanisms between these taxa. We examined two sperm traits, sperm swimming speed and flagellum length, in pure dwarf and normal whitefish and in their F1 and backcross hybrids. We observed significantly reduced sperm swimming speed in backcross but not in F1 hybrids. Sperm flagellum length was not significantly correlated with sperm swimming speed. These results demonstrate that F1 hybrids formed in nature should be capable of the same fertilization success as the parental species during sperm competition, everything else being equal. However, reduced sperm performance in the backcross generation is consistent with other evidence suggesting that genomic incompatibilities create a range of negative fitness effects in post-F1 whitefish hybrids and provides evidence for an additional postzygotic isolation mechanism involved in the incipient speciation of sympatric dwarf and normal whitefish.},

abstract = {Non-native species diversity of plants and fishes in the contiguous 48 United States is analyzed to measure the influence of human population size, time of modern settlement, area and native species diversity. Besides exotic (from outside USA) plants, four types of non-native fishes are examined: established exotic fishes, reported exotic fishes, US fishes not native to a state, and native state fishes moved to new locations in a state. Human population size is most highly correlated with exotic plant diversity (r {\textgreater} 70{\%}) but is still significantly correlated with most types of non-native fish diversity. Time of modern settlement significantly increases non-native plant (but not most fish) diversity, even after the effects of current population size are removed. These patterns occur because most non-native plants are imported for landscaping, farming and other uses intimately linked to human settlements whereas, almost half of non-native fishes were released by state agencies for sport, often into large western states with relatively few humans. This also explains why state area is significantly correlated with all types of non-native fish diversity, but not non-native plant diversity where smaller eastern states have more people and more years of settlement which increase non-native plant diversity. Positive correlation of non-native plant diversity with native plant diversity is found, as humans tend to settle in states with high native species diversity. In contrast, negative correlation between non-native fish and native fish diversity is found. These findings may help predict non-native species diversity if past trends continue. They also imply that the most cost-effective way to slow non-native species impact may be to focus where human population is still small, because rate of establishment of non-native species decreases with increasing human population. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Urban noise is composed of low frequencies, thus the observation that songs have a higher minimum frequency in noisy places suggests this is a way of avoiding noise masking. Most studies are correlative and there is as yet little experimental evidence that this is a short-term mechanism owing to individual plasticity. Here we experimentally test if house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) can modulate the minimum frequency of their songs in response to different noise levels. We exposed singing males to three continuous treatments: low-high-low noise levels. We found a significant increase in minimum frequency from low to high and a decrement from high to low treatments. We also found that this was mostly achieved by modifying the frequency of the same low-frequency syllable types used in the different treatments. When different low-frequency syllables were used, those sung during the noisy condition were longer than the ones sang during the quiet condition. We conclude that house finches modify their songs in several ways in response to urban noise, thus providing evidence of a short-term acoustic adaptation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interactions between wildlife and humans are increasing. Urban animals are often less wary of humans than their non-urban counterparts, which could be explained by habituation, adaptation or local site selection. Under local site selection, individuals that are less tolerant of humans are less likely to settle in urban areas. However, there is little evidence for such temperament-based site selection, and even less is known about its underlying genetic basis. We tested whether site selection in urban and non-urban habitats by black swans (Cygnus atratus) was associated with polymorphisms in two genes linked to fear in animals, the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) and serotonin transporter (SERT) genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Wariness in swans was highly repeatable between disturbance events (repeatability = 0.61) and non-urban swans initiated escape from humans earlier than urban swans. We found no inter-individual variation in the SERT gene, but identified five DRD4 genotypes and an association between DRD4 genotype and wariness. Individuals possessing the most common DRD4 genotype were less wary than individuals possessing rarer genotypes. As predicted by the local site selection hypothesis, genotypes associated with wary behaviour were over three times more frequent at the non-urban site. This resulted in moderate population differentiation at DRD4 (FST = 0.080), despite the sites being separated by only 30 km, a short distance for this highly-mobile species. Low population differentiation at neutrally-selected microsatellite loci and the likely occasional migration of swans between the populations reduces the likelihood of local site adaptations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that wariness in swans is partly genetically-determined and that wary swans settle in less-disturbed areas. More generally, our findings suggest that site-specific management strategies may be necessary that consider the temperament of local animals.},

abstract = {• A key question in ecological genetics is to what extent do plants adapt to changes in climatic conditions, such as drought, through plasticity or evolution. • To address this question, seeds of 140 maternal families of Brassica rapa were generated from collections made before (1997) and after (2004) a natural drought. These seeds were planted in the glasshouse and grown under low-water and high-water conditions. • Post-drought lines flowered earlier than pre-drought lines, showing an evolutionary shift to earlier flowering. There was significant genetic variation and genotype by environment (G × E) interactions in flowering time, indicating genetic variation in plasticity in this trait. Plants that flowered earlier had fewer leaf nodes and lower instantaneous (A/g) and integrated ($\delta$(13) C) water use efficiency than late-flowering plants. • These results suggest that B. rapa plants escape drought through early flowering rather than avoid drought through increased water use efficiency. The mechanism of this response appears to be high transpiration and inefficient water use, leading to rapid development. These findings demonstrate a trade-off between drought avoidance and escape, and indicate that, in this system, where drought acts to shorten the growing season, selection for drought escape through earlier flowering is more important than phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract = {The analysis of gene interactions and epistatic patterns of susceptibility is especially important for investigating complex diseases such as cancer characterized by the joint action of several genes. This work is motivated by a case-control study of bladder cancer, aimed at evaluating the role of both genetic and environmental factors in bladder carcinogenesis. In particular, the analysis of the inflammation pathway is of interest, for which information on a total of 282 SNPs in 108 genes involved in the inflammatory response is available. Detecting and interpreting interactions with such a large number of polymorphisms is a great challenge from both the statistical and the computational perspectives. In this paper we propose a two-stage strategy for identifying relevant interactions: (1) the use of a synergy measure among interacting genes and (2) the use of the model-based multifactor dimensionality reduction method (MB-MDR), a model-based version of the MDR method, which allows adjustment for confounders.},

abstract = {Loci with higher levels of population differentiation than the neutral expectation are traditionally interpreted as evidence of ongoing selection that varies in space. This article emphasizes an alternative explanation that has been largely overlooked to date: in species subdivided into large subpopulations, enhanced differentiation can also be the signature left by the fixation of an unconditionally favorable mutation on its chromosomal neighborhood. This is because the hitchhiking effect is expected to diminish as the favorable mutation spreads from the deme in which it originated to other demes. To discriminate among the two alternative scenarios one needs to investigate how genetic structure varies along the chromosomal region of the locus. Local hitchhiking is shown to generate a single sharp peak of differentiation centered on the adaptive polymorphism and the standard signature of a selective sweep only in those subpopulations in which the allele is favored. Global hitchhiking produces two domes of differentiation on either side of the fixed advantageous mutation and signatures of a selective sweep in every subpopulation, albeit of different magnitude. Investigating population differentiation around a locus that strongly differentiates two otherwise genetically similar populations of the marine mussel Mytilus edulis, plausible evidence for the global hitchhiking hypothesis has been obtained. Global hitchhiking is a neglected phenomenon that might prove to be important in species with large population sizes such as many marine invertebrates.},

abstract = {1. Induced resistance is now widely accepted as a potent and widespread ecological force although several pieces of the story remain very poorly known. Theory predicts that induced defences should be favoured in variable environments especially when plants can use cues to reliably predict future conditions; however, this idea has not been seriously evaluated for plants. 2. Theory also predicts that plastic, induced defences should be favoured over permanent, constitutive defences if defences are costly and not always needed. This hypothesis has received considerable attention and limited support; resource allocation costs have been difficult to detect although ecological costs of defence may be more common. Recently, priming has emerged as a mechanism that may further reduce costs. Primed plants do not immediately produce the gene products associated with induced resistance but later respond more rapidly and strongly to severe or repeated attacks. It remains to be determined how common priming is. 3. Much of what we know about induced resistance is from the herbivore's point of view. Induced resistance will be beneficial from the plant's point of view if herbivores avoid induced plants, but the behavioural responses of herbivores to induced plant variation are still poorly studied. 4. Recent progress in understanding the detailed spatial and temporal extent of induced resistance has improved our appreciation of the phenomenon. Although some induced responses are systemic throughout entire plant individuals, many others have been found to be localized to damaged tissues. Plant vascular architecture and transpiration rates greatly constrain the distribution of vascular cues. Some plants rely on volatile cues that are active over relatively short distances and may be subject to eavesdropping by other plants, herbivores, and carnivores. Similarly, the temporal duration of induced responses may have important consequences on effectiveness although limited information is available concerning lag times before induction and relaxation times following induction. 5. Limited spatial and temporal scales of induced responses make plants more variable from the herbivore's point of view. Recent work suggests that plant heterogeneity may be difficult for herbivores to cope with although this hypothesis awaits further empirical testing.},

abstract = {Should we have different expectations regarding the likelihood and pace of speciation by sexual selection when considering species with sexually monomorphic mating signals? Two conditions that can facilitate rapid species divergence are Felsenstein's one-allele mechanism and a genetic architecture that includes a genetic association between signal and preference loci. In sexually monomorphic species, the former can manifest in the form of mate choice based on phenotype matching. The latter can be promoted by selection acting upon genetic loci for divergent signals and preferences expressed simultaneously in each individual rather than separately, on signal loci in males and preference loci in females. Both sexes in the Chrysoperla carnea-group of green lacewings (Insecta, Neuroptera, Chrysopidae) produce sexually monomorphic species-specific mating signals. We hybridized the two species C. agilis and C. carnea to test for evidence of these speciation-facilitating conditions. Hybrid signals were more complex than the parents and we observed a dominant influence of C. carnea. We found a dominant influence of C. agilis on preferences in the form of hybrid discrimination against C. carnea. Preferences in hybrids followed patterns predicting preference loci that determine mate choice rather than a one-allele mechanism. The genetic association between signal and preference we detected in the segregating hybrid crosses indicate that speciation in these species with sexually monomorphic mating signals can have occurred rapidly. However, we need additional evidence to determine whether such genetic associations form more readily in sexually monomorphic species compared to dimorphic species and consequently facilitate speciation.

abstract = {How strong is phenotypic selection on quantitative traits in the wild? We reviewed the literature from 1984 through 1997 for studies that estimated the strength of linear and quadratic selection in terms of standardized selection gradients or differentials on natural variation in quantitative traits for field populations. We tabulated 63 published studies of 62 species that reported over 2,500 estimates of linear or quadratic selection. More than 80{\%} of the estimates were for morphological traits; there is very little data for behavioral or physiological traits. Most published selection studies were unreplicated and had sample sizes below 135 individuals, resulting in low statistical power to detect selection of the magnitude typically reported for natural populations. The absolute values of linear selection gradients |beta| were exponentially distributed with an overall median of 0.16, suggesting that strong directional selection was uncommon. The values of |beta| for selection on morphological and on life-history/phenological traits were significantly different: on average, selection on morphology was stronger than selection on phenology/life history. Similarly, the values of |beta| for selection via aspects of survival, fecundity, and mating success were significantly different: on average, selection on mating success was stronger than on survival. Comparisons of estimated linear selection gradients and differentials suggest that indirect components of phenotypic selection were usually modest relative to direct components. The absolute values of quadratic selection gradients |gamma| were exponentially distributed with an overall median of only 0.10, suggesting that quadratic selection is typically quite weak. The distribution of gamma values was symmetric about 0, providing no evidence that stabilizing selection is stronger or more common than disruptive selection in nature.},

We assess the relationships between genetic, environmental, and geographic distance among populations. We use 11 climatic variables and point locality data from public databases to create ecological niche models. The suitability of potential contact zones between parapatric lineages is also assessed using the data from ecological niche modeling. Phylogenetic analyses of portions of the mitochondrial genome reveal morphologically cryptic mitochondrial lineages in this species. In addition, we find that patterns of genetic divergence are strongly associated with divergence in the ecological niche. Our work demonstrates the ease and utility of using spatial analyses of environmental data and phylogenetics in species delimitation, especially for groups displaying fine-scaled endemism and cryptic species.},

abstract = {Ecological speciation is the promotion of reproductive isolation via the divergent adaptation of populations to alternative environments. A prediction peculiar to ecological speciation is that hybrids between such populations should be adapted poorly to parental environments, yielding reduced fitness and postmating isolation. However, F(1) analyses alone cannot demonstrate that ecological ("extrinsic") factors contribute to such isolation. Rather, this requires documenting a "switch" in the relative fitnesses of reciprocal backcrosses between environments. Specifically, each backcross should exhibit higher fitness in the environment of its pure parent, with which it shares the most genes, including environment-specific ones. In contrast, because genetic proportions are expected to be similar for all backcrosses ( approximately (3/4) from one parental type and approximately (1/4) from the other), the more general genetic incompatibilities responsible for "intrinsic" isolation predict no such environment-specific fitness switches. Thus, although intrinsic isolation may contribute to the fitness reduction and variation underlying such patterns, it offers an insufficient explanation for them. Here, we present a quantitative genetic "backcross" analysis of sympatric Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf beetle populations adapted to maple versus willow host plants. Results statistically supported ecological speciation predictions, notably the switch in relative fitness for backcross types, the expected rank order of cross type fitnesses, and appreciable extrinsic isolation. We additionally documented genetic variation in host-associated fitness, ruled out nongenetic maternal effects, and discuss the maintenance of ecological differentiation in sympatry. In summary, our study provides a rare and strongly supported demonstration of genetically based, ecologically dependent postmating isolation during ecological speciation.},

Hybrids between these species form quite readily in the laboratory, but, if given a choice of species to mate with, some are able to avoid hybridization. F1 hybrids are viable but sterile: the gametes they produce are inviable. For one pair of species, hybrid sterility is probably caused by chromosomal rearrangements, but for all the other species, the major cause of hybrid sterility is antirecombination-the inability of diverged chromosomes to form crossovers during F1 hybrid meiosis. Surprisingly, incompatibility between the genes expressed from different species' genomes is not a major cause of F1 hybrid sterility, although it may contribute to reproductive isolation at other stages of the yeast life cycle.},

At mid-20th century a steep cline of melanic phenotype frequency running from the north of Wales to the southern coast of England separated a region of 5{\%} or less to west from 90{\%} or more to northeast. By the 1980s the plateau of 90{\%} frequency had contracted to northern England. The frequency has since continued to drop so that the maximum is now less than 50{\%} and in most places below 10{\%}. There have been similar declines in Europe and North America. Evidence from surveys and from two-point records shows the change to require 5{\%} to 20{\%} selection against the melanic. The melanic is more disadvantageous in regions where its frequency was initially high than in regions where it was low. Experiments to investigate predation by birds show a net advantage to carbonaria morphs in regions where typical frequencies were low at the time of the experiment, and a disadvantage where typical frequencies were high. This would be expected if environment and frequency were associated, and selective predation played a part in generating the association. The cryptic advantage of carbonaria was large in areas of heavy pollution where typical frequencies were 20{\%} or less. The moth usually has a low density but is relatively highly mobile. The ability of present information to explain the patterns has been tested in simulations. They indicate a system under strong selection that has always been in a dynamic state without equilibria.},

Discriminant analyses demonstrated distinct morphological separation between the genetically "pure" parental species. Morphometric analyses of genetically identified hybrids showed: I) an extreme range ofphenotypic expression within F, and backcross classes, and 2) no apparent directional parental bias on the F, phenotype. Had morphology alone been used as a guide, over 40 percent of the individuals with known hybrid ancestry would have been misclassified as "pure" parental species, and about 25 percent of the backcross individuals would not have been distinguished from F, 's. These results exemplify the utility ofjoint comparisons of morphology and genotypic constitution in studies of natural hybridization, and they emphasize the limitations inherent in describing hybrid classes solely by morphological criteria.},

If urban deermaintain species' typical matrilineal genetic structure, removal of female groups may effectively reduce local abundance. However, if gene flow in urban areas is high, dispersal may impede efforts to reduce abundance. Although genetic diversity was high and mean relatedness was near zero in all locations, distributions of pairwise relatedness in urban metroparks and the fenced reserve contained greater proportions of closely and distantly related deer than the open locations, likely attributable to matrilineal structure. In addition, deer from the metroparks (approx. 65 km apart) were moderately differentiated (Fst ¼ 0.092) indicating gene flow in urban areas may be less than in other landscapes. Our results indicate that removal of matrilineal groups may reduce local urban deer abundance without inducing immigration from surrounding areas.},

We compared body shape, diet, growth, and survival in present-day Enos fish with trait data in the undisturbed Paxton Lake species pair and with historical Enos Lake data. In both Paxton and historical Enos data, we found a strong correlation between body shape and diet; however, in present-day Enos fish, this correlation was absent. Using fitness estimates based on growth rates and survival, we found no evidence of selection against intermediate morphologies. It appears that postmating isolation has broken down, allowing hybrids to persist and contributing to the collapse of the species pair.},

abstract = {Marked diversification of genital morphology is common in internally fertilizing animals. Although sexual selection may be the primary process controlling genital evolution, factors promoting genital evolution are controversial, and the genetic background of genital morphology is poorly understood. We analyzed the genetic basis of species-specific genital morphologies in carabid beetles of the subgenus Ohomopterus (genus Carabus, Carabidae) using two parapatric species with hybrid zones. Biometric analyses on experimental F(1) and backcross populations revealed that inheritance of genital morphology is polygenic. Applying Lande's modification of the Castle-Wright estimator to population means and variances to estimate the minimum number of genes involved, we found that a relatively small number of loci is responsible for species differences in genital morphology. In addition, joint-scaling tests indicated that the additive genetic effect accounts for most interspecific differences in genital traits, but dominance and epistatic genetic effects also play roles. Overall, the genetic basis of male and female genitalia is fairly simple, enabling these traits to respond quickly to selection pressures and to diverge rapidly. Our results provide insight into the diversification of genital morphology in carabid beetles, and will hopefully stimulate further studies on the genetic basis of genitalia, such as mapping of quantitative trait loci affecting species-specific genital morphology.},

These biophysical attributes in turn are key predictors of habitat suitability, community composition, and species distribution and abundance.

abstract = {Unravelling the form of selection acting on hybrids of ecotypes undergoing ecological speciation is essential to understand the mechanisms behind the evolution of reproductive isolation in the face of gene flow. Shell phenotype is known to be affected by natural selection and is involved in the fitness of the marine snail Littorina saxatilis. Here, we studied the association between shell traits and fitness in hybrids in order to determine the relative role of exogenous and endogenous selection in this hybrid zone of L. saxatilis. We show that directional selection is the predominant mode of selection among hybrids. We also show its heterogeneity, affecting different shell traits, within populations at the level of the microhabitat. Therefore, endogenous selection mechanisms are most probably lacking in this hybrid zone and exogenous barriers (pre- and post-zygotic) are possibly one of the main forces behind the evolution of barriers to gene flow between these ecologically divergent ecotypes. This study shows how this barrier might represent an important type of reproductive isolation within ecological speciation, and this should be taken into account in future studies of speciation in hybrid zones.},

abstract = {Chromosome doubling plays an important role in generating new species of flowering plants. However, reproductive incompatibilities between newly formed tetraploid plants and their diploid progenitors are expected to create a significant barrier to the persistence and establishment of neopolyploid populations. Ecological differentiation can reduce this barrier via prezygotic isolation arising from spatial separation. Alternatively, superior viability or fecundity of neotetraploid plants might compensate for the reproductive cost of incompatible pollen from diploid neighbors. The performance of plants of both cytotypes can be assessed in their respective habitats through reciprocal transplants, although such experiments have not been used previously in the study of tetraploid speciation. We used a series of seed and seedling transplant experiments to assess ecological differentiation and competitive ability during early establishment phases for tetraploid and diploid forms of the snow buttercup (Ranunculus adoneus). At two sites, seeds from diploids and tetraploids had similar germination probabilities. Tetraploid snow buttercup seedlings had a significant growth advantage in a controlled environment chamber experiment. However, in the field diploid and tetraploid buttercup seedlings did not differ consistently in survival or growth, nor did the two cytotypes show reciprocal advantages in performance, as expected if ecological differentiation has occurred. At the seed and seedling stages, neither niche differentiation nor tetraploid competitive superiority appears sufficient to explain neotetraploid success in the presence of their diploid progenitors.},

abstract = {Pollinator selectivity is thought to influence the evolution of separate sexes in plants because of its potential to limit plant reproductive success. Selective visitation could also constrain or promote the phenotypic divergence of the sexes. In this study, I explored the causes and consequences of selectivity by generalist pollinators of a gynodioecious wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) and thus provide insight into potential pollinator-mediated selection for dioecy and sexual dimorphism. I found that flowers of F. virginiana show pronounced sexual dimorphism in petal length, stamen length, nectar and pollen production, and that this results in dramatic and consistent levels of sex-differential visitation by ants, bees, and flies. I performed manipulations of hermaphrodite flowers to understand the basis of selectivity and found that much of bee and fly preference for hermaphrodite flowers derived from their strong preference for longer petals, but also from a more subtle preference for pollen-filled anthers. These studies also revealed that other traits contribute to the observed discrimination against females. A stronger relationship existed between bee visitation and pollen receipt in females than between bee visitation and pollen removal from hermaphrodites. An analysis of natural variation in petal and stamen length confirmed the central role of petal length and also showed a lack of an effect of vestigial stamen length in pollination success of females. It also revealed a significant effect of stamen length, but not of petal length, on pollen removal. The data suggest that pollinator selectivity may affect the evolution of floral sexual dimorphism, both by exerting selection that could lead to the maintenance of stamens in females and by exerting selection to increase petal length in females.},

abstract = {Conspecific pollen precedence can be a strong reproductive barrier between polyploid and diploid species, but the role of genome multiplication in the evolution of this barrier has not been investigated. Here, we examine the direct effect of genome duplication on the evolution of pollen siring success in tetraploid Chamerion angustifolium. To separate the effects of genome duplication from selection after duplication, we compared pollen siring success of synthesized tetraploids (neotetraploids) with that of naturally occurring tetraploids by applying 2x, 4x (neo or established) or 2x + 4x pollen to diploid and tetraploid flowers. Seed set increased in diploids and decreased in both types of tetraploids as the proportion of pollen from diploid plants increased. Based on offspring ploidy from mixed-ploidy pollinations, pollen of the maternal ploidy always sired the majority of offspring but was strongest in established tetraploids and weakest in neotetraploids. Pollen from established tetraploids had significantly higher siring rates than neotetraploids when deposited on diploid (4x(est) = 47.2{\%}, 4x(neo) = 27.1{\%}) and on tetraploid recipients (4x(est) = 91.9{\%}, 4x(neo) = 56.0{\%}). Siring success of established tetraploids exceeded that of neotetraploids despite having similar pollen production per anther and pollen diameter. Our results suggest that, while pollen precedence can arise in association with the duplication event, the strength of polyploid siring success evolves after the duplication event.},

abstract = {The cross between Arabidopsis thaliana and the closely related species Arabidopsis arenosa results in postzygotic hybrid incompatibility, manifested as seed death. Ecotypes of A. thaliana were tested for their ability to produce live seed when crossed to A. arenosa. The identified genetic variation was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) encoded by the A. thaliana genome that affect the frequency of postzygotic lethality and the phenotypes of surviving seeds. Seven QTLs affecting the A. thaliana component of this hybrid incompatibility were identified by crossing a Columbia × C24 recombinant inbred line population to diploid A. arenosa pollen donors. Additional epistatic loci were identified based on their pairwise interaction with one or several of these QTLs. Epistatic interactions were detected for all seven QTLs. The two largest additive QTLs were subjected to fine-mapping, indicating the action of at least two genes in each. The topology of this network reveals a large set of minor-effect loci from the maternal genome controlling hybrid growth and viability at different developmental stages. Our study establishes a framework that will enable the identification and characterization of genes and pathways in A. thaliana responsible for hybrid lethality in the A. thaliana × A. arenosa interspecific cross.},

abstract = {Interspecific hybridization can generate transgressive hybrid phenotypes with extreme trait values exceeding the combined range of the parental species. Such variation can enlarge the working surface for natural selection, and may facilitate the evolution of novel adaptations where ecological opportunity exists. The number of quantitative trait loci fixed for different alleles in different species should increase with time since speciation. If transgression is caused by complementary gene action or epistasis, hybrids between more distant species should be more likely to display transgressive phenotypes. To test this prediction we collected data on transgression frequency from the literature, estimated genetic distances between the hybridizing species from gene sequences, and calculated the relationship between the two using phylogenetically controlled methods. We also tested if parental phenotypic divergence affected the occurrence of transgression. We found a highly significant positive correlation between transgression frequency and genetic distance in eudicot plants explaining 43{\%} of the variance in transgression frequency. In total, 36{\%} of the measured traits were transgressive. The predicted effect of time since speciation on transgressive segregation was unconfounded by the potentially conflicting effects of phenotypic differentiation between species. Our analysis demonstrates that the potential impact hybridization may have on phenotypic evolution is predictable from the genetic distance between species.},

Both species live sympatrically as annuals on two small copper mines in Calaveras county, California, USA. There are almost no other species present in the areas where Mimulus dominates. The production of seed by the two species was compared. The relationship between capsule number and plant height differs, with M. cupriphilus having the steeper slope, so that at any particular height it produces more capsules. Mean seed number per capsule, and the relationship between seed number and size of plant, also varies between the two species. M. cupriphilus is normally self-fertilizing, and thus has a higher probability that a capsule will be fertilized than M. guttatus, which relies more on fertilization by insects. The various parameters can be combined to produce a predicted relationship between size of plant and seed production. When plants are small, M. cupriphilus will produce more seeds, but at heights greater than about 9 cm M. guttatus will be fitter. The overall resource allocation pattern also reveals that M. cupriphilus devotes a greater proportion of its dry weight to seed and capsule production. These results show that in the habitat where the two species co-exist, arid deserted copper mines, the derived species is better adapted.},

Reproductive isolation of diverging populations is a critical step at the onset of speciation. An excellent example for exploring the extent of reproductive isolation at early stages of speciation is provided by Heliosperma pusillum and H. veselskyi (Caryophyllaceae), two reciprocally non-monophyletic, ecologically differentiated species from the Alps. Interspecific gene flow-as revealed by recent genetic studies-is rare even between geographically close populations. Cross pollinations and fitness experiments revealed no evidence of intrinsic reproductive barriers, since fitness parameters measured under uniform conditions were not lower in inter- than in intraspecific crosses. Further, morphometric analyses of the offspring clearly showed that the differentiation of parental species is heritable. As parental phenotypes are likely adaptive, the intermediate morphology of hybrids may lead to reduced hybrid fitness in parental habitats. Altogether, H. pusillum and H. veselskyi provide an increasingly well characterised model system offering exciting insights into early stages of ecological speciation.},

We evaluated the accumulation of quantitative trait loci (QTL) between species in the plant group Solanum and found evidence for a faster-than-linear accumulation of hybrid seed sterility QTL, thus empirically evaluating and confirming this theoretical prediction.

abstract = {Insect parasitoids are a major component of global biodiversity and affect the population dynamics of their hosts. However, identification of insect parasitoids is often difficult, and they are suspected to contain many cryptic species. Here, we ask whether the cytochrome c oxidase I DNA barcode could function as a tool for species identification and discovery for the 20 morphospecies of Belvosia parasitoid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae) that have been reared from caterpillars (Lepidoptera) in Area de Conservaci{\'{o}}n Guanacaste (ACG), northwestern Costa Rica. Barcoding not only discriminates among all 17 highly host-specific morphospecies of ACG Belvosia, but it also raises the species count to 32 by revealing that each of the three generalist species are actually arrays of highly host-specific cryptic species. We also identified likely hybridization among Belvosia by using a variable internal transcribed spacer region 1 nuclear rDNA sequence as a genetic covariate in addition to the strategy of overlaying barcode clusters with ecological information. If general, these results will increase estimates of global species richness and imply that tropical conservation and host-parasite interactions may be more complex than expected.},

abstract = {We explore the effects of,ender dimorphism on resistance (damage avoidance) and tolerance (growth and fitness compensation) to a flower bud clipping weevil in a gynodioecious wild strawberry. Using both natural populations and a common garden, we document pervasive hermaphrodite-biased damage and identify several floral traits associated with resistance. Lower flower number, lower pollen production per flower, and earlier flowering date were associated with higher resistance. Because the sex morphs do not differ in flower number or flowering time, the presence of pollen is the main factor determining sex-differential resistance. We confirmed that simulated clipping was a good surrogate for weevil clipping, and we used simulated clipping to assess sex-morph- and sex-function-specific tolerance. We found that females were less tolerant than hermaphrodites in terms of seed and fruit production, but the sex morphs were similarly unable to compensate fully in flower production. Hermaphrodites showed some ability to compensate in pollen per flower, but this was not large enough to offset flower losses, leading to net undercompensation for pollen per plant. We evaluated potential mechanisms for tolerance and found that the number of reserve buds was the most consistent predictor of tolerance. Finally, we found that herbivory shifted sex expression of hermaphrodites toward greater femaleness via both plastic changes in allocation and direct effects of loss of male-functioning flowers. Our work indicates that the effects of herbivory on sexual system evolution can include sexual phenotype-biased herbivore damage and sex-dependent tolerance, as well as herbivory-induced changes in hermaphrodite sex allocation. In addition, this study suggests that pollen production is subject to selection via herbivores that opposes selection mediated by pollinators.},

abstract = {Adaptation lies at the heart of Darwinian evolution. Accordingly, numerous studies have tried to provide a formal framework for the description of the adaptive process. Of these, two complementary modeling approaches have emerged: While so-called adaptive-walk models consider adaptation from the successive fixation of de novo mutations only, quantitative genetic models assume that adaptation proceeds exclusively from preexisting standing genetic variation. The latter approach, however, has focused on short-term evolution of population means and variances rather than on the statistical properties of adaptive substitutions. Our aim is to combine these two approaches by describing the ecological and genetic factors that determine the genetic basis of adaptation from standing genetic variation in terms of the effect-size distribution of individual alleles. Specifically, we consider the evolution of a quantitative trait to a gradually changing environment. By means of analytical approximations, we derive the distribution of adaptive substitutions from standing genetic variation, that is, the distribution of the phenotypic effects of those alleles from the standing variation that become fixed during adaptation. Our results are checked against individual-based simulations. We find that, compared to adaptation from de novo mutations, (i) adaptation from standing variation proceeds by the fixation of more alleles of small effect and (ii) populations that adapt from standing genetic variation can traverse larger distances in phenotype space and, thus, have a higher potential for adaptation if the rate of environmental change is fast rather than slow.},

abstract = {Determining which forms of reproductive isolation have the biggest impact on the process of divergence is a major goal of speciation research. These barriers are often divided into those that affect the potential for hybridization (premating isolation), and those that occur after mating (postmating isolation), and much debate has surrounded the relative importance of these categories. Within the species Mimulus aurantiacus, red-and yellow-flowered ecotypes occur in the southwest corner of California, and a hybrid zone occurs where their ranges overlap. We show that premating barriers are exclusively responsible for isolation in this system, with both ecogeographic and pollinator isolation contributing significantly to total isolation. Postmating forms of reproductive isolation have little or no impact on gene flow, indicating that hybrids likely contribute to introgression at neutral loci. Analysis of molecular variation across thousands of restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) markers reveals that the genomes of these taxa are largely undifferentiated. However, structure analysis shows that these taxa are distinguishable genetically, likely due to the impact of loci underlying differentiated adaptive phenotypes. These data exhibit the power of divergent natural selection to maintain highly differentiated phenotypes in the face of gene flow during the early stages of speciation. K E Y W O R D S : Biological species concept, ecogeographic isolation, pollinator isolation, postmating barriers, premating barriers. As the ultimate source of taxonomic diversity, the process of speciation has fascinated generations of biologists. The modern evolutionary synthesis saw a flurry of work on the subject that culminated with the emergence of the biological species concept, which delimits species by the presence of reproductive isolation (Dobzhansky 1937; Mayr 1942; Stebbins 1950; Mayr 1963). Tra-ditionally, reproductive barriers are divided into those that affect the potential for hybridization (premating isolation), and those that occur after mating (postmating isolation). Reproductive bar-riers also can be separated into those that evolve as byproducts of ecologically based divergent natural selection on particular traits (Schluter 2001; Rundle and Nosil 2005), or genetic incompati-bilities that can be the result of drift or indirect selection (Orr and Turelli 2001), genetic conflict (Presgraves 2007; Fishman and Saunders 2008; Phadnis and Orr 2009), or mutation order dynamics (Mani and Clarke 1990; Schluter 2009).},

Demonstrations of 'parallel speciation', or assortative mating by selective environment, link ecology and isolation(3-5), but the phenotypic traits mediating isolation have not been confirmed. Here we show that the parallel build-up of mating incompatibilities between stickleback populations can be largely accounted for by assortative mating based on one trait, body size, which evolves predictably according to environment. In addition to documenting the influence of body size on reproductive isolation for stickleback populations spread across the Northern Hemisphere, we have confirmed its importance through a new experimental manipulation. Together, these results suggest that speciation may arise largely as a by-product of ecological differences and divergent selection on a small number of phenotypic traits.},

Sequences were searched against a tailored reference database of Moroccan medicinal plants and their closest relatives using BLAST and Blastclust, and through inference of RAxML phylograms of the aligned market and reference samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequencing success was high for rpoC1, psbA-trnH, and ITS, but low for matK. Searches using rpoC1 alone resulted in a number of ambiguous identifications, indicating insufficient DNA variation for accurate species-level identification. Combining rpoC1, psbA-trnH and ITS allowed the majority of the market samples to be identified to genus level. For a minority of the market samples, the barcoding identification differed significantly from previous hypotheses based on the vernacular names.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Endemic plant species are commercialized in Marrakech. Adulteration is common and this may indicate that the products are becoming locally endangered. Nevertheless the majority of the traded roots belong to species that are common and not known to be endangered. A significant conclusion from our results is that unknown samples are more difficult to identify than earlier suggested, especially if the reference sequences were obtained from different populations. A global barcoding database should therefore contain sequences from different populations of the same species to assure the reference sequences characterize the species throughout its distributional range.},

Regarding multivariate analysis, the error caused by missing species was at least as important as the error in visual estimation of species cover. The estimates of degree of cover using the Braun-Blanquet scale are sufficiently reliable for use in multivariate analysis when they are subjected to ordinal transformation.

Noise pollution puts a severe constraint on vocal communication by interfering with the detection of acoustic signals. Recent studies showthat city birds sing higher-frequency songs than their con- specifics in non-urban habitats. This has been interpreted as an adaptation to counteract masking by traffic noise. However, this notion is debated, for the observed frequency shifts seemto be less efficient at mitigating noise than sing- ing louder, and it has been suggested that city birds might use particularly high-frequency song elements because they can be produced at higher ampli- tudes. Here, we present the first phonetogram for a songbird, which shows that frequency and amplitude are strongly positively correlated in the common blackbird (Turdus merula), a successful urban colonizer. Moreover, city blackbirds preferentially sang higher-frequency elements that can be pro- duced at higher intensities and, at the same time, happen to be less masked in low-frequency traffic noise. 1.},

abstract = {Polymorphisms in the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4) have been related to individual variation in novelty-seeking or exploratory behaviour in a variety of animals, including humans. Recently, the human DRD4 orthologue was sequenced in a wild bird, the great tit (Parus major) and a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 3 of this gene (SNP830) was shown to be associated with variation in exploratory behaviour of lab-raised individuals originating from a single wild population. Here we test the generality of this finding in a large sample of free-living individuals from four European great tit populations, including the originally sampled population. We demonstrate that the association between SNP830 genotype and exploratory behaviour also exists in free-living birds from the original population. However, in the other three populations we found only limited evidence for an association: in two populations the association appeared absent; while in one there was a nonsignificant tendency. We could not confirm a previously demonstrated interaction with another DRD4 polymorphism, a 15 bp indel in the promoter region (ID15). As yet unknown differences in genetic or environmental background could explain why the same genetic polymorphism (SNP830) has a substantial effect on exploratory behaviour in one population, explaining 4.5-5.8{\%} of the total variance-a large effect for a single gene influencing a complex behavioural trait-but not in three others. The confirmation of an association between SNP830 genotype and personality-related behaviour in a wild bird population warrants further research into potential fitness effects of the polymorphism, while also the population differences in the strength of the association deserve further investigation. Another important future challenge is the identification of additional loci influencing avian personality traits in the wild.},

abstract = {Predictive distribution modeling of species and communities has gained much importance in recent years. In this paper, generalized linear models (GLM) are implemented in a Geographical Information System to mimic the spatial distribution of alpine and subalpine species habitat and diversity in the study area of Belalp (Aletsch region, Wallis, Swiss Alps). Quantitative predictors used to quantify environmental requirements of species are: annual mean temperature, slope angle, topographic position, solar radiation, snow cover indices and the three spectral bands of a color infrared aerial photograph, as well as disjunctive classes of qualitative substrate-related predictors. Presence-absence logistic GLM are adjusted for 63 species. Percent ground cover measured on an ordinal scale is additionally modeled using a special case of GLM for 26 species with significant variation of abundance in the field. Both ordinal abundance and presence/absence at each spatial location are successfully modeled for some species, as shown by quantitative evaluation using an independent data set. Finally, species richness (SR) is modeled by (i) using a Poisson GLM and (ii) summing up single species predictions by presence/absence models. Successful models are finally used to mimic potential impact of climatic change on plant distribution and diversity. Results from these scenarios suggest (i) an overall trend toward a reduction of suitable habitat for alpine species and (ii) two different responses for the distribution of SR, namely: (a) a serious shift of the optimal SR elevation belt upward in elevation or (b) the SR optimal belt shifting only slightly upward in elevation, accompanied by a parallel spatial spread out of high SR patches at, these elevations. Limitations of both species and diversity models are discussed and some suggestions for future research are proposed.},

abstract = {The dramatic increase in human activities all over the world has caused, on an evolutionary time scale, a sudden rise in especially low-pitched noise levels. Ambient noise may be detrimental to birds through direct stress, masking of predator arrival or associated alarm calls, and by interference of acoustic signals in general. Two of the most important functions of avian acoustic signals are territory defence and mate attraction. Both of these functions are hampered when signal efficiency is reduced through rising noise levels, resulting in direct negative fitness consequences. Many bird species are less abundant near highways and studies are becoming available on reduced reproductive success in noisy territories. Urbanization typically leads to homogenization of bird communities over large geographical ranges. We review current evidence for whether and how anthropogenic noise plays a role in these patterns of decline in diversity and density. We also provide details of a case study on great tits (Parus major), a successful urban species. Great tits show features that other species may lack and make them unsuitable for city life. We hypothesize that behavioural plasticity in singing behaviour may allow species more time to adapt to human-altered environments and we address the potential for microevolutionary changes and urban speciation in European blackbirds (Turdus merula). We conclude by providing an overview of mitigating measures available to abate noise levels that are degrading bird breeding areas. Bird conservationists probably gain most by realizing that birds and humans often benefit from the same or only slightly modified measures.},

abstract = {Allopatric speciation is thought to be a dominant mode of diversification in many sexual organisms (Mayr 1963; Bush 1975; White 1978). In addition to the well-established frequent occurrence of polyploid speciation in plants (Grant 1971), parapatric (clinal) and sympatric patterns of speciation have also been proposed for some animal taxa (Fisher 1958, ch. 6; Bush 1975; Endler 1977; White 1978). The current theory of allopatric speciation developed by Mayr (1954; 1963, ch. 17; 1970) attempts to deduce from genetic principles an observed tendency toward phenotypic change in small isolated populations, with relative phenotypic uniformity across the main range of a species. Gene flow and genetic homeostasis are supposed to confer "genetic cohesion" on large central populations, both in terms of their continued interbreeding and phenotypic similarity. In small periph-erally isolated populations, it is claimed, the "founder effect" drastically reduces genetic variability and may initiate a "genetic revolution" which produces re-productive isolation and permits or induces morphological change. Although Mayr's emphasis on allopatric speciation in animals has been questioned, there has been little critical analysis of the process itself, utilizing genetic models of populations. Neglect of basic quantitative considerations left certain ambiguities and errors in Mayr's theory, which are rectified here by reviewing and generaliz-ing dynamic models of genetic variation and phenotypic evolution in small isolated populations. Relevant data on variation, mutation, and selection of morphological characters are used to evaluate the models. In a population which is geographically isolated from the main range of a species, reproductive isolation can evolve only incidentally as a by-product of genetic divergence occurring for other reasons. This justifies the construction of dynamic models of phenotypic evolution during allopatric speciation, in which reproductive isolation plays no causal role. Substantial evidence from hybridiza-tion experiments demonstrates that subspecies and congeneric species usually differ by many genes with small phenotypic effects (Dobzhansky 1951, pp. 143-148, 226; Mayr 1963, p. 543; Wright 1978a, ch. 8). Furthermore, quantitative variation in natural populations generally has a polygenic basis (Wright 1968, ch.},

abstract = {Species integrity can be challenged, and even eroded, if closely related species can hybridize and produce fertile offspring of comparable fitness to that of parental species. The maintenance of newly diverged or closely related species therefore hinges on the establishment and effectiveness of pre- and/or post-zygotic reproductive barriers. Ecological selection, including predation, is often presumed to contribute to reduced hybrid fitness, but field evidence for a predation cost to hybridization remains elusive. Here we provide proof-of-concept for predation on hybrids being a postzygotic barrier to gene flow in the wild. Cyprinid fishes commonly produce fertile, viable hybrid offspring and therefore make excellent study organisms to investigate ecological costs to hybrids. We electronically tagged two freshwater cyprinid fish species (roach Rutilus rutilus and bream Abramis brama) and their hybrids in 2005. Tagged fish were returned to their lake of origin, exposing them to natural predation risk from apex avian predators (great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo). Scanning for regurgitated tags under cormorant roosts 3-4 years later identified cormorant-killed individual fish and allowed us to directly test for a predation cost to hybrids in the wild. Hybrid individuals were found significantly more susceptible to cormorant predation than individuals from either parental species. Such ecological selection against hybrids contributes to species integrity, and can enhance species diversification.},

It now numbers about 70 breeding pairs. Populations across the entire natural range of the subspecies J. h. thurberi are weakly differentiated from each other at five microsatellite loci (FST = 0.01). The UCSD population is significantly different from these populations, the closest of which is 70 km away. It has 88{\%} of the genetic heterozygosity and 63{\%} of the allelic richness of populations in the montane range of the subspecies, consistent with a harmonic mean effective population size of 32 (but with 95{\%} confidence limits from four to {\textgreater} 70) over the eight generations since founding. Results suggest a moderate bottleneck in the early establishment phase but with more than seven effective founders. Individuals in the UCSD population have shorter wings and tails than those in the nearby mountains and a common garden experiment indicates that the morphological differences are genetically based. The moderate effective population size is not sufficient for the observed morphological differences to have evolved as a consequence of genetic drift, indicating a major role for selection subsequent to the founding of the UCSD population.},

abstract = {Despite the dominating role of pollinators in ﬂoral evolution, mounting evidence reveals signiﬁcant additional, often antagonistic, inﬂuences of abiotic and biotic non-pollinator agents. Even when pollinators and other agents impose selection on ﬂoral traits in the same direction, the role of other agents is fre- quently overlooked. Maintenance of genetic variation in ﬂoral traits and divergence from trait optima for pollination can result from both indirect selection on correlated traits and direct selection on ﬂoral traits. For example, in numerous species, periods of heat or drought favour pink- or purple-ﬂowered individuals over white-ﬂowered ones, because associated anthocyanins in vegetative tissues enhance stress tolerance. Conﬂicting selection on ﬂoral traits may also occur directly when ﬂoral antagonists and mutualists share the same preferences. We review the evidence for inﬂuences of abiotic and biotic non–pollinator agents of selection on several ﬂoral traits: petal colour, ﬂower and display size, ﬂower shape, nectar composition, ﬂowering phenology, and breeding system. Despite growing evidence of the importance of non-pollinator selection, few studies have explored the relative strength of selection from pollinators versus other sources. In several cases, pollinators are not the strongest current source of selection on ﬂoral traits, despite perhaps being the driving factor shaping ﬂoral traits historically. Future studies will beneﬁt from a synthetic approach that recognizes the entire ecological context of ﬂoral adaptation and combines ﬁeld experiments with genetic studies to determine the relative roles of pollinators and non-pollinator agents in ﬂoral evolution. The study of ﬂoral evolution will be enhanced by approaches that incorporate a broader context that includes both abiotic and biotic agents of selection.},

All traits showed significant induction in at least one of the species. Jasmonate application only partially mimicked the effect of monarch feeding. We found some correspondence between latex and cardenolide content and reduced larval growth. Larvae fed cut leaves of A. angustifolia grew better than larvae fed intact plants. Addition of the cardenolide digitoxin to cut leaves reduced larval growth but ouabain (at the same concentration) had no effect. We, thus, confirm that latex and cardenolides are major defenses in milkweeds, effective against a specialist herbivore. Other traits such as proteases and C/N ratio additionally may be integrated in the defense scheme of those plants. Induction seems to play an important role in plants that have an intermediate level of defense, and we advocate incorporating induction as an additional axis of the plant defense syndrome hypothesis.},

Unreduced gametes result from a plethora of different mechanisms across different taxa, suggesting that the ability to produce unreduced gametes has evolutionary utility. Heritable genetic variation for unreduced gamete production has been observed, thereby providing an evolutionary substrate. Unreduced gametes are also frequently involved in interspecific hybridisation events as well as being produced by interspecific hybrids, facilitating allopolyploidisation. Environmental stress often triggers unreduced gamete production, suggesting that unreduced gametes may facilitate polyploid speciation in response to changing environments. Thus, although unreduced gamete formation may be a meiotic mishap, we suggest that unreduced gametes can be more explicitly considered as a mechanism for evolutionary speciation that should be measured and tested across and within lineages for exaptive evolution (a feature with evolutionary utility that has not arisen under conventional selective pressure) and evolvability (the capacity to generate adaptive genetic variation).},

Commonly used methods to separate neutral effects from adaptive effects are based on locus-specific population differentiation coefficients to identify outliers. Here we extend such an approach to estimate directly the probability that each locus is subject to selection using a Bayesian method. We also extend it to allow the use of dominant markers like AFLPs. It has been shown that this model is robust to complex demographic scenarios for neutral genetic differentiation. Here we show that the inclusion of isolated populations that underwent a strong bottleneck can lead to a high rate of false positives. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to avoid them by carefully choosing the populations that should be included in the analysis. We analyze two previously published data sets: a human data set of codominant markers and a Littorina saxatilis data set of dominant markers. We also perform a detailed sensitivity study to compare the power of the method using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), SNP, and microsatellite markers.

abstract = {Effects and consequences of stress exposure on life history strategies and quantitative genetic variation in wild populations remain poorly understood. We here study whether long-term exposure to heavy metal pollution may result in alternative life history strategies and alter quantitative genetic properties in natural populations of the wolf spider Pirata piraticus. Offspring originating from a reference and a metal contaminated population and their reciprocal hybrid cross were bred in a half-sib mating scheme and subsequently reared in cadmium contaminated vs. clean environment. Results from this experiment provided evidence for a genetically based reduced growth rate and increased egg size in the contaminated population. Growth rate reduction in response to cadmium contamination was only observed for the reference population. Animal model analysis revealed that heritability for growth rate was large for the reference population under reference conditions, but much lower under metal stressed conditions, caused by a strong decrease in additive genetic variance. Heritability for growth of the metal contaminated population was very low, even under reference conditions. Initial size of the offspring was primarily determined by maternal effects, whereas egg size produced by the offspring was determined by both sire and dam effects, indicating that egg size determination is under control of the female genotype. In conclusion, these results show that metal stress can not only affect life history variation in natural populations, but also decreases the expression as well as the of the amount of genetic variation for particular life history traits.},

To better link the genetics with the process of speciation, we propose that 'speciation gene' be defined as any gene contributing to the evolution of reproductive isolation.

Review of a sample of candidate speciation genes found that few meet these criteria.

In southern Spain, southern Portugal and northern Morocco, males coexist with monoecious (cosex) individuals at frequencies which vary between zero and about 30 per cent. Here, I report the results of two glasshouse experiments which aimed to characterize the mode of sex determination in one such androdioecious population. In a breeding experiment, cosexes isolated from males produced only cosexual progeny, whereas those allowed to mate with males produced both cosexual and male offspring. The results are consistent with a single-locus model of sex inheritance, with maleness determined by a dominant allele. In a density experiment, the frequency of males correlated positively with density, confirming field observations. Differential mortality or germination between the sexes was excluded by experimental design, so that the result supports the hypothesis of density- dependent gender choice. A negative correlation between density and the proportion of 'late cosexes' (males which turned cosexual late in their development), and the lack of any differences in the proportion of pure (unchanged) cosexes between density, suggest that only males were capable of sex change. This interpretation is consistent with the results of the breeding experiment, in which late cosexes occurred only in the offspring of cosexes allowed to mate with males. I argue that these findings help to explain the maintenance of androdioecy in M. annua.},

We identified several fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs) in the R of M. sexta and the closely related species Manduca quinquemaculata which, when synthesized and applied to mechanical wounds at concentrations comparable with those found in R, elicited all three R-specific responses. Ion-exchange treatment of R, which removed all detectable FACs and free fatty acids (FAs), also removed all detectable activity. The biological activity of ion-exchanged R could be completely restored by the addition of synthetic FACs at R-equivalent concentrations, whereas the addition of FAs did not restore the biological activity of R. We conclude that the biological activity of R is not related to the supply of FAs to the octadecanoid cascade for endogenous jasmonate biosynthesis, but that FACs elicit the herbivore-specific responses by another mechanism and that the insect-produced modification of plant-derived FAs is necessary for the plant's recognition of this specialized herbivore.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that shape macroevolutionary patterns in functional traits is a central goal of evolutionary biology. Alternative strategies of sexual reproduction (inbreeding vs. outcrossing) have divergent effects on population genetic structure and could thereby broadly influence trait evolution. However, the broader evolutionary consequences of mating system transitions remain poorly understood, with the exception of traits related to reproduction itself (e.g., pollination). Across a phylogeny of 56 wild species of Solanaceae (nightshades), we show here that the repeated, unidirectional transition from ancestral self-incompatibility (obligate outcrossing) to self-compatibility (increased inbreeding) leads to the evolution of an inducible (vs. constitutive) strategy of plant resistance to herbivores. We demonstrate that inducible and constitutive defense strategies represent evolutionary alternatives and that the magnitude of the resulting macroevolutionary tradeoff is dependent on the mating system. Loss of self-incompatibility is also associated with the evolution of increased specificity in induced plant resistance. We conclude that the evolution of sexual reproductive variation may have profound effects on plant-herbivore interactions, suggesting a new hypothesis for the evolution of two primary strategies of plant defense.},

abstract = {Adaptation in the wild often involves standing genetic variation (SGV), which allows rapid responses to selection on ecological timescales. However, we still know little about how the evolutionary histories and genomic distributions of SGV influence local adaptation in natural populations. Here, we address this knowledge gap using the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model. We extend restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to produce phased haplotypes approaching 700 base pairs (bp) in length at each of over 50,000 loci across the stickleback genome. Parallel adaptation in two geographically isolated freshwater pond populations consistently involved fixation of haplotypes that are identical-by-descent. In these same genomic regions, sequence divergence between marine and freshwater stickleback, as measured by dXY, reaches tenfold higher than background levels and genomic variation is structured into distinct marine and freshwater haplogroups. By combining this dataset with a de novo genome assembly of a related species, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), we find that this habitat-associated divergent variation averages six million years old, nearly twice the genome-wide average. The genomic variation that is involved in recent and rapid local adaptation in stickleback has therefore been evolving throughout the 15-million-year history since the two species lineages split. This long history of genomic divergence has maintained large genomic regions of ancient ancestry that include multiple chromosomal inversions and extensive linked variation. These discoveries of ancient genetic variation spread broadly across the genome in stickleback demonstrate how selection on ecological timescales is a result of genome evolution over geological timescales, and vice versa.},

abstract = {The urban environment was used to study the plant reproductive system in small fragmented populations as well as the potential adaptations of plants to urban conditions. We examined the effect of density on the pollination process and on reproduction in urban populations of the allogamous species Crepis sancta. The habitat is composed of small uncultivated square patches (c. 2 m2) regularly spaced along the pavement in streets of the city of Montpellier, France. Pollinator behaviour (the presence of pollinators, the number of flowers visited and the duration of each visit) and seed set as a function of the number of plants in patches and selfing rates, determined using progeny array analysis, were studied. The propensity for the urban populations to produce seeds by self-fertilization in insect-proof glasshouse was also analysed. We found strong evidence of reduced pollinator activities at low densities, resulting in reduced pollination and a reduction in seed set from 80 to 20{\%} of ovules fertilized (the Allee effect). Progeny array analysis revealed a slight increase (marginally significant) in selfing rates in urban populations compared with large populations. In spite of lower pollinator activity, urban populations did not show a greater ability to self-fertilize compared with rural populations from the nearby countryside.},

abstract = {Recent genetic studies have suggested that many genes contribute to differences between closely related species that prevent gene exchange, particularly hybrid male sterility and female species preferences. We have examined the genetic basis of hybrid sterility and female species preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis, two occasionally hybridizing North American species. Contrary to findings in other species groups, very few regions of the genome were associated with these characters, and these regions are associated also with fixed arrangement differences (inversions) between these species. From our results, we propose a preliminary genic model whereby inversions may contribute to the speciation process, thereby explaining the abundance of arrangement differences between closely related species that co-occur geographically. We suggest that inversions create linkage groups that cause sterility to persist between hybridizing taxa. The maintenance of this sterility allows the species to persist in the face of gene flow longer than without such inversions, and natural selection will have a greater opportunity to decrease the frequency of interspecies matings.},

abstract = {Vegetation surveys have a long tradition in ecological studies, but several limitations in the morphological identification of species have been recognized. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of DNA barcoding in plant species identification to save field technicians time and resources. Vegetation surveys were performed in four plots of semi-dry grassland in the Italian subalpine region of Lombardy. Two identification approaches were employed: a conventional morphological identification and a molecular multi-marker DNA barcoding method. Results showed that morphological identification of 49 species collected from the study area (five field inspections) required a substantial amount of time to complete relative to the molecular method. The same 49 samples were analysed using the following DNA multi-marker barcodes: rbcL, matK and trnH-psbA. rbcL showed 100{\%} amplification success with standard primers, but low interspecific genetic variability. matK demonstrated some amplification problems with standard primers; however, consistent genetic diversity was observed. Finally, the trnH-psbA spacer region exhibited reliable amplification success and the highest molecular variability. In a comparison with publicly available databases, trnH-psbA and matK returned the highest proportion of identified samples, whereas rbcL returned several misidentifications. The DNA barcoding approach is a powerful tool in vegetation surveys and may significantly reduce the time and cost spent for species identification. However, to effectively apply DNA barcoding in vegetation surveys, exhaustive local or regional molecular databases must be defined. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 169, 518–529.},

abstract = {Modelling the distribution of rare and invasive species often occurs in situations where reliable absences for evaluating model performance are unavailable. However, predictions at randomly located sites, or ‘background' sites, can stand in for true absences. The maximum value of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, AUC, calculated with background sites is believed to be 1-�−-�a/2, where a is the typically unknown prevalence of the species on the landscape. Using a simple example of a species' range, I show how AUC can achieve values {\textgreater}-�1-�−-�a/2 when test presences do not represent each inhabited region of a species{\_}{\_} range in proportion to its area. Values of AUC that surpass 1-�−-�a/2 are associated with higher model predictions in areas overrepresented in the test data set, even if they are less environmentally suitable than other regions the species occupies. Pursuit of high AUC values can encourage inclusion of spurious predictors in the final model if they help to differentiate areas with disproportionate representation in the test data. Choices made during modelling to increase AUC calculated with background sites on the assumption that higher scores connote more accurate models can decrease actual accuracy when test presences disproportionately represent inhabited areas},

abstract = {Objective methods of monitoring snow-covered areas by optical remote sensing were evaluated using synchronous observations conducted with the passage of the Landsat-7 satellite over the plains of Niigata prefecture, one of the snowiest regions in Japan. The observations were conducted in the springs of 2002 and 2003. Snow-covered areas were identified using three methods: (1) visible (red) reflectance, (2) Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) which uses visible and shortwave-infrared reflectances, and (3) a newly proposed snow index called S3 which uses visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared reflectances. The Snow-Cover Ratio (SCR) was defined as the ratio of the number of pixels in snow-covered areas to the total number of pixels in an image. The threshold value for the three indices used to identify snow-covered areas was defined as 50{\%} of SCR, which converged to nearly the same value regardless of the images analysed. Under clear conditions, visible (red) reflectance can identify snow-covered areas accurately if no vegetation is present. NDSI can distinguish snow-covered areas from mixels (mixed pixels) of snow and vegetation by referring to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). S3 can distinguish snow-covered areas from mixels of snow and vegetation without any reference data. S3 is, therefore, more useful than NDSI because it automatically distinguishes snow-covered areas from mixels of snow and vegetation.},

We worked with two aboriginal cultures namely 'Irulas' and 'Malasars' of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve with an objective of evaluating the ability of different knowledge systems (SK and TK) to distinguish grass species belonging to the genus Tripogon, and assess the ability of DNA barcoding to discriminate a new cryptic species 'Tripogon cope' as deciphered by the hill tribes. We discovered that the aboriginal informants identified a common ethnotaxa 'Sunai pul', which is a cryptic species of grass not recognized by the SK classification.'sunai pul' is very important to both aboriginal cultures with ritualistic and economic utility. Morphometric analysis confirms the cryptic nature of this new species, which was validated using DNA barcoding. DNA barcode regions matK and trnH-psbA showed distinct sequence variations among the closely related ethnotaxa. Given the cryptic nature of ethnotaxa, we propose that a DNA barcode may be a reliable tool to identify ethnotaxa. We have initiated further studies in other cultures to develop theoretically sophisticated insights concerning the encounter between 'local' and 'scientific' approaches to the use of biodiversity knowledge. Furthermore, the research will add to a unifying global effort to speed up the documentation and understanding of the planet's natural diversity, while simultaneously respecting the cultural heterogeneity as a vital component of biological diversity.},

abstract = {Historically, six small lakes in southwestern British Columbia each contained a sympatric species pair of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These pairs consisted of a 'benthic' and 'limnetic' species that had arisen postglacially and, in four of the lakes, independently. Sympatric sticklebacks are considered biological species because they are morphologically, ecologically and genetically distinct and because they are strongly reproductively isolated from one another. The restricted range of the species pairs places them at risk of extinction, and one of the pairs has gone extinct after the introduction of an exotic catfish. In another lake, Enos Lake, southeastern Vancouver Island, an earlier report suggested that its species pair is at risk from elevated levels of hybridization. We conducted a detailed morphological analysis, as well as genetic analysis of variation at five microsatellite loci for samples spanning a time frame of 1977 to 2002 to test the hypothesis that the pair in Enos Lake is collapsing into a hybrid swarm. Our morphological analysis showed a clear breakdown between benthics and limnetics. Bayesian model-based clustering indicated that two morphological clusters were evident in 1977 and 1988, which were replaced by 1997 by a single highly variable cluster. The most recent 2000 and 2002 samples confirm the breakdown. Microsatellite analysis corroborated the morphological results. Bayesian analyses of population structure in a sample collected in 1994 indicated two genetically distinct populations in Enos Lake, but only a single genetic population was evident in 1997, 2000, and 2002. In addition, genetic analyses of samples collected in 1997, 2000, and 2002 showed strong signals of 'hybrids'; they were genetically intermediate to parental genotypes. Our results support the idea that the Enos Lake species pair is collapsing into a hybrid swarm. Although the precise mechanism(s) responsible for elevated hybridization in the lake is unknown, the demise of the Enos Lake species pair follows the appearance of an exotic crayfish, Pascifasticus lenisculus, in the early 1990s.},

abstract = {The genetic architecture of trait differentiation was evaluated between two ecologically distinct populations of Chamaecrista fasciculata. Individuals from Maryland and Illinois populations were crossed to create 10 types of seed: Maryland and Illinois parents, reciprocal F1 and F2 hybrids, and backcrosses to Maryland and to Illinois on reciprocal F1 hybrids. Reciprocal crosses created hybrid generation seeds with both Maryland and Illinois cytoplasmic backgrounds. Experimental individuals were grown in a common garden near the site of the Maryland population. In the garden, plants from the Illinois population flowered, set fruit, and died earlier than those from Maryland, likely reflecting adaptations to differences in growing season length between the two populations. Although reproductive components at the flower and whole plant level differed between the two populations, reproductive output as measured by fruit and seed production was similar. Cytoplasmic genes had a subtle but pervasive effect on population differentiation; hybrids with Maryland cytoplasm were significantly differentiated from those with Illinois cytoplasm when all characters were evaluated jointly. The nuclear genetic architecture of population differentiation was evaluated with joint scaling tests. Depending on the trait, both additive and nonadditive genetic effects contributed to population differentiation. Intraspecific genetic differentiation in this wild plant species appears to reflect a complex genetic architecture that includes the contribution of additive, dominance, and epistatic components in addition to subtle cytoplasmic effects.},

abstract = {Changes in weed species composition on a specific site can occur in response to any agricultural production practices. Species that are best adapted to a particular practice are selected for and the species will increase in the population over a period of time. Over the past 50 years, repeated use of herbicides has resulted in the evolution of resistant weed species. Currently, 216 herbicide resistant weed biotypes in 45 countries have been documented. The rapid increase in the number of cases of herbicide resistance in many agricultural areas in the world verifies that the phenomenon is global. The first resistant weed species to triazines was discovered in 1970 in the United States. Presently, at least 60 weed species have been documented with one or more biotypes resistant to triazine herbicides in the world. Fifty-three weed species have evolved resistance to ALS inhibitor herbicides in 14 countries. Nineteen weed species have evolved resistance to ACCase inhibitors in 17 countries. Fourteen weed species have evolved resistance to urea herbicides. There are 26 weed species resistant to bipyridilium herbicides and 17 weed species resistant to synthetic auxins. Mechanisms of resistance to herbicides is attributed to: i) modified photosystem II protein-binding site (triazines and uracils), ii) modified ALS -binding site (sulfonylureas and imidazolinones), iii) enhanced detoxification (aryloxyphenoxy propionates and substituted ureas), iv) enhanced detoxification and br sequestration (bipyridiniums) and v) hyperstabilized microtubules (dinitroanilines). Herbicide resistance has also been observed in developing countries. Some of the species include Phalaris minor resistant to isoproturon (India), P. minor and P. paradoxa resistant to diclofop (Mexico), Echinochloa colona resistant to propanil (Columbia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua), Conyza bonariensis resistant to paraquat (Egypt) and Echinochloa crusgallii resistant to butachlor (China and Egypt). Multiple resistance to more than one class of herbicides with different modes of action have been identified. Chlorotoluron resistance to Alopecurus myosuroides (UK), trifluralin resistance to Eleusine indica (Canada, USA), diclofop-methyl resistance to Lolium rigidum (Australia), metsulfuron resistance to Lactuca serriola (USA) have been noted. The discovery of glyphosate resistant Lolium rigidum in Australia (1996) and Lolium multiflorum in California (1998) has definitely reminded us the continual evolution of herbicide resistant weed species. For the last two decades, a significant progress has been made in the area of herbicide resistance, including mechanism of resistance, community and population ecology, and management tactics for resistant species. The present global widespread of weed resistance to different classes of herbicides has clearly reached the stage where more concerted efforts in research and education is needed. At the same time, we must not forget the ecological implications of these species in production agricultural systems.},

abstract = {Parallel evolution of similar traits by independent populations in similar environments is considered strong evidence for adaptation by natural selection. Often, however, replicate populations in similar environments do not all evolve in the same way, thus deviating from any single, predominant outcome of evolution. This variation might arise from non-adaptive, population- specific effects of genetic drift, gene flow or limited genetic variation. Alternatively, these deviations from parallel evolution might also reflect predictable adaptation to cryptic environmental heterogeneity within discrete habitat categories. Here, we show that deviations from parallel evolution are the consequence of environmental variation within habitats combined with variation in gene flow. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in adjoining lake and stream habitats (a lake–stream ‘pair') diverge phenotypically, yet the direction and magnitude of this divergence is not always fully parallel among 16 replicate pairs. We found that the multivariate direction of lake–stream morphological divergence was less parallel between pairs whose environmental differences were less parallel. Thus, environmental heterogeneity among lake–stream pairs contributes to deviations from parallel evolution. Additionally, likely genomic targets of selection were more parallel between environmentally more similar pairs. In contrast, variation in the magnitude of lake–stream divergence (independent of direction) was better explained by differences in lake–stream gene flow; pairs with greater lake–stream gene flow were less morphologically diverged. Thus, both adaptive and non-adaptive processes work concurrently to generate a continuum across lake-stream sticklebacks},

With short-read sequencing technology, we assembled a draft sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Rafflesia lagascae Blanco, a species endemic to the Philippine island of Luzon, with ∼350× sequencing depth coverage. Using multiple approaches, however, we were only able to identify small fragments of plastid sequences at low coverage depth ({\textless}2×) and could not recover any substantial portion of a chloroplast genome. The gene fragments we identified included photosynthesis and energy production genes (atp, ndh, pet, psa, psb, rbcL), ribosomal RNA genes (rrn16, rrn23), ribosomal protein genes (rps7, rps11, rps16), transfer RNA genes, as well as matK, accD, ycf2, and multiple nongenic regions from the inverted repeats. None of the identified plastid gene sequences had intact reading frames. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that ∼33{\%} of these remnant plastid genes may have been horizontally transferred from the host plant genus Tetrastigma with the rest having ambiguous phylogenetic positions ({\textless}50{\%} bootstrap support), except for psaB that was strongly allied with the plastid homolog in Nicotiana. Our inability to identify substantial plastid genome sequences from R. lagascae using multiple approaches--despite success in identifying and developing a draft assembly of the much larger mitochondrial genome--suggests that the parasitic plant genus Rafflesia may be the first plant group for which there is no recognizable plastid genome, or if present is found in cryptic form at very low levels.},

abstract = {Despite their central importance for the evolution of physiological variation, the genetic mechanisms that determine energy expenditure in animals have largely remained unstudied. We used quantitative genetics to confirm that both mass-specific and whole-organism basal metabolic rate (BMR) were heritable in a captive-bred population of stonechats (Saxicola torquata spp.) founded on birds from three wild populations (Europe, Africa and Asia) that differed in BMR. This argues that BMR is at least partially under genetic control by multiple unknown nuclear loci each with a limited effect on the phenotype. We then tested for a genetic effect on BMR based on mitochondrial-nuclear coadaptation using hybrids between ancestral populations with high and low BMR (Europe-Africa and Asia-Europe), with different parental configurations (female(high)-male(low) or female(low)-male(high)) within each combination of populations. Hybrids with different parental configurations have on average identical mixtures of nuclear DNA, but differ in mitochondrial DNA because it is inherited only from the mother. Mass-specific BMR differed between hybrids with different parental configurations, implying that the combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA affected metabolic rate. Therefore, our findings implicate mitochondrial function as an important regulator of energy metabolism. In combination with the substantial heritabilities of metabolic rate, and corroborated by genetic differences in the mitochondrial genome, these results set the stage for further investigations of a genetic control mechanism involving both mitochondrial and nuclear genes determining metabolic rate at the whole-organism level.},

abstract = {MaxEnt is a program for modelling species distributions from presence-only species records. This paper is written for ecologists and describes the MaxEnt model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of MaxEnt which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of MaxEnt describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies.},

abstract = {Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, {\ldots}. We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1∕M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast as 1∕M.},

Although this has not been documented for any plant parasite system, genetic variation in induction has been recently reported for several plant-parasite systems. Correlations between induction and fitness in variable parasite environments suggest that inducibility may indeed be subject to selection, however, these studies focussed on phenotypic (not genetic) correlations. Our current state of knowledge suggests that induced defenses may be an example of adaptive plasticity, where defenses enhance plant fitness when parasites are present, and reduce fitness when parasites are absent. Future work that focuses on consequences of genetic variation in induction and macro-evolutionary trends in inducible versus constitutive defense will help advance our understanding of the evolutionary biology of induced plant defense.},

abstract = {How individuals colonising novel environments overcome the diverse suite of new selection pressures is a fundamental question in ecology and evolution. Urban environments differ markedly from the rural ones that they replace and successful colonisation of urban areas may therefore require local adaptation and phenotypic/genetic divergence from ancestral populations. Such a process would be facilitated by limited dispersal to and from the novel habitat. Here we assess divergence in migratory behaviour between seven pairs of urban and rural European blackbird Turdus merula populations along a 2800 km transect across Europe. This former forest specialist is now amongst the most abundant urban birds across most of its range. We use a stable isotope approach due to the lack of sufficient ringing data from multiple urban populations, and compare hydrogen isotopic ratios of tissues grown in the breeding (feathers) and wintering areas (claws) to derive an index of long distance migratory behaviour. We find a tendency for urban blackbirds to be more sedentary than rural ones at all sites and this divergence is particularly strong at the north-eastern limit of our transect, i.e. in Estonia and Latvia. These urban populations are those that have been established most recently (from the late 1930s to 1950s) implying that urbanisation can promote rapid ecological divergence. The increased sedentary behaviour of urban birds could promote further ecological divergence between rural and urban populations, such as the earlier breeding of urban blackbirds, and in some cases may contribute to their previously documented genetic divergence.},

abstract = {Publication of The Genetics of Colonizing Species in 1965 launched the field of invasion genetics and highlighted the value of biological invasions as natural ecological and evolutionary experiments. Here, we review the past 50 years of invasion genetics to assess what we have learned and what we still don't know, focusing on the genetic changes associated with invasive lineages and the evolutionary processes driving these changes. We also suggest potential studies to address still-unanswered questions. We now know, for example, that rapid adaptation of invaders is common and generally not limited by genetic variation. On the other hand, and contrary to prevailing opinion 50 years ago, the balance of evidence indicates that population bottlenecks and genetic drift typically have negative effects on invasion success, despite their potential to increase additive genetic variation and the frequency of peak shifts. Numerous unknowns remain, such as the sources of genetic variation, the role of so-called expansion load and the relative importance of propagule pressure vs. genetic diversity for successful establishment. While many such unknowns can be resolved by genomic studies, other questions may require manipulative experiments in model organisms. Such studies complement classical reciprocal transplant and field-based selection experiments, which are needed to link trait variation with components of fitness and population growth rates. We conclude by discussing the potential for studies of invasion genetics to reveal the limits to evolution and to stimulate the development of practical strategies to either minimize or maximize evolutionary responses to environmental change.},

abstract = {Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change.},

abstract = {Snow-cover information is important for a wide variety of scientific studies, water supply and management applications. The NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides improved capabilities to observe snow cover from space and has been successfully using a normalized difference snow index (NDSI), along with threshold tests, to provide global, automated binary maps of snow cover. The NDSI is a spectral band ratio that takes advantage of the spectral differences of snow in short-wave infrared and visible MODIS spectral bands to identify snow versus other features in a scene. This study has evaluated whether there is a "signal" in the NDSI that could be used to estimate the fraction of snow within a 500 m MODIS pixel and thereby enhance the use of the NDSI approach in monitoring snow cover. Using Landsat 30-m observations as "ground truth," the percentage of snow cover was calculated for 500-m cells. Then a regression relationship between 500-m NDSI observations and fractional snow cover was developed over three different snow-covered regions and tested over other areas. The overall results indicate that the relationship between fractional snow cover and NDSI is reasonably robust when applied locally and over large areas like North America. The relationship offers advantages relative to other published fractional snow cover algorithms developed for global-scale use with MODIS. This study indicates that the fraction of snow cover within a MODIS pixel using this approach can be provided with a mean absolute error less than 0.1 over the range from 0.0 to 1.0 in fractional snow cover. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Latex is a sticky emulsion that exudes upon damage from specialized canals in about 10{\%} of flowering plant species. Latex has no known primary metabolic function and has been strongly implicated in defense against herbivorous insects. Here we review historical hypotheses about the function of latex, evidence that it serves as a potent defense, and the chemistry and mode of action of the major constituent defense chemicals and proteins across a diversity of plant species. We further attempt to synthesize the characteristics of latex as a coordinated plant defense system. Herbivores that feed on latex-bearing plants typically evade contact with latex by severing the laticifers or feeding intercellularly, or may possess physiological adaptations. Convergent evolution appears to be rampant both in plants with latex and insects that exploit latex-bearing plants. Because latex shows phenotypic plasticity, heritability, and macoevolutionary lability, it is an ideal system to study plant-herbivore interactions us...},

abstract = {Reproductive assurance is often invoked as an explanation for the evolution of self-fertilization in plants. However, key aspects of this hypothesis have received little empirical support. In this study, I use geographic surveys of pollinator communities along with functional studies of floral trait variation to examine the role of pollination ecology in mating system differentiation among populations and subspecies of the annual plant Clarkia xantiana. A greenhouse experiment involving 30 populations from throughout the species' range indicated that variation in two floral traits, herkogamy and protandry, was closely related to levels of autofertility and that trait variation was partitioned mainly among populations. Emasculation experiments in the field showed that autonomous selfing confers reproductive assurance by elevating fruit and seed production. Surveys of pollinator communities across the geographic range of the species revealed that bee pollinator abundance and community composition differed dramatically between populations of the outcrossing subspecies xantiana and the selfing subspecies parviflora despite their close proximity. Specialist bee pollinators of Clarkia were absent from selfing populations, but they were the most frequent visitors to outcrossing populations. Moreover, within the outcrossing subspecies xantiana, there was a close correspondence between specialist abundance and population differentiation in herkogamy, a key mating system trait. This spatial covariation arose, in part, because geographically peripheral populations had reduced herkogamy, higher autofertility, and lower pollinator abundance compared to central populations of xantiana. Finally, I detected strong spatial structure to bee communities both across the range of the species and within the outcrossing subspecies. In both cases, spatial structure was stronger for specialist bees compared to generalist bees, and pollinator communities varied in parallel with population variation in herkogamy. These results provide evidence that mating system differentiation parallels spatial variation in pollinator abundance and community composition at both broad and more restricted spatial scales, consistent with the hypothesis that pollinator abundance and reproductive assurance are important drivers of plant mating system evolution.},

A Russian population where females are capable of sustained ascending flight and a North American population with females incapable of flight were crossed: parentals, reciprocal F(1) hybrids, double reciprocal F(2) hybrids, and all possible backcrosses to both the parental lines were compared. Heritabilities were estimated using a threshold model, female offspring on female parent regressions, and joint-scaling analyses. Heritability of female flight capability measured using a free flight test was at least 0.60, and variation in wing size, muscle strength, and flight behaviors contributed to the flight polymorphism. Relative wing size varied continuously and had a heritability of 0.70. Environmental variation accounted for {\textgreater}90{\%} of the variation in female preflight weight and relative flight muscle strength, as estimated by an inverted female's ability to right herself. Preflight walking behavior and early deposition of eggs were each inherited through a single gene with two co-dominant alleles. There was no evidence for sex-linkage or maternal effects in female flight capability or associated traits. Continued vigilance to exclude and eradicate introductions of strains capable of female flight in North America is warranted even in areas where no females fly, because some of the alleles needed for full flight capability may not be present in the North American populations, and some flight capability is maintained in the hybrids that could increase the rate of spread of L. dispar.},

It follows then that species living in these contexts should participate in and experience the same suite of biological processes, including evolution, that have occupied scientists for centuries in more "natural" contexts. In fact, urban ecosystems with myriad novel contexts, pressures, and species rosters provide unprecedentedly potent evolutionary stimuli. Here, we present the case for studying adaptive evolution in urban settings. We then review and synthesize techniques into a coherent approach for studying adaptive evolution in urban settings that combines observations of phenotypic divergence, measurements of fitness benefits of novel genetically based phenotypes, and experimental manipulations of potential drivers of adaptation. We believe that studying evolution in urban contexts can provide insights into fundamental evolutionary biology questions on rate, direction, and repeatability of evolution, and may inform species and ecosystem service conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Cities profoundly alter biological communities, favoring some species over others, though the mechanisms that govern these changes are largely unknown. Herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant in urban than in rural areas, and urban outbreaks have been attributed to reduced control by predators and parasitoids and to increased susceptibility of stressed urban plants. These hypotheses, however, leave many outbreaks unexplained and fail to predict variation in pest abundance within cities. Here we show that the abundance of a common insect pest is positively related to temperature even when controlling for other habitat characteristics. The scale insect Parthenolecanium quercifex was 13 times more abundant on willow oak trees in the hottest parts of Raleigh, NC, in the southeastern United States, than in cooler areas, though parasitism rates were similar. We further separated the effects of heat from those of natural enemies and plant quality in a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment. P. quercifex collected from hot urban trees became more abundant in hot greenhouses than in cool greenhouses, whereas the abundance of P. quercifex collected from cooler urban trees remained low in hot and cool greenhouses. Parthenolecanium quercifex living in urban hot spots succeed with warming, and they do so because some demes have either acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures. Our results provide the first evidence that heat can be a key driver of insect pest outbreaks on urban trees. Since urban warming is similar in magnitude to global warming predicted in the next 50 years, pest abundance on city trees may foreshadow widespread outbreaks as natural forests also grow warmer.},

abstract = {The hypothesis of sympatric speciation by sexual selection has been contentious. Several recent theoretical models of sympatric speciation by disruptive sexual selection were tailored to apply to African cichlids. Most of this work concludes that the genetic architecture of female preference and male trait is a key determinant of the likelihood of disruptive sexual selection to result in speciation. We investigated the genetic architecture controlling male nuptial colouration in a sympatric sibling species pair of cichlid fish from Lake Victoria, which differ conspicuously in male colouration and female mating preferences for these. We estimated that the difference between the species in male nuptial red colouration is controlled by a minimum number of two to four genes with significant epistasis and dominance effects. Yellow colouration appears to be controlled by one gene with complete dominance. The two colours appear to be epistatically linked. Knowledge on how male colouration segregates in hybrid generations and on the number of genes controlling differences between species can help us assess whether assumptions made in simulation models of sympatric speciation by sexual selection are realistic. In the particular case of the two sister species that we studied a small number of genes causing major differences in male colouration may have facilitated the divergence in male colouration associated with speciation.},

We used nine microsatellite loci to analyze the population genetic structure of the Sigmodontine rodent Calomys musculinus in two anthropically altered habitats: an agroecosystem and a city. Rodents inhabiting urban vacant lots showed higher levels of relatedness and genetic differentiation than rodents inhabiting the agroecosystem. Urban rodents presented a pattern of isolation by distance; in the rural habitat this pattern was present only along the border of a secondary road, but not over the entire area surveyed. In the city, a spatially limited but buffered environment, populations would be small, demographically stable, and dispersal would be restricted. On the contrary, in agroecosystems populations would experience a high rate of turn over: local demes would originate each year by a mixture of overwintering individuals, and dispersal would occur preferentially along the weedy borders of fields. ?? 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft f??r S??ugetierkunde.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Recent analyses employing up to five genes have provided numerous insights into angiosperm phylogeny, but many relationships have remained unresolved or poorly supported. In the hope of improving our understanding of angiosperm phylogeny, we expanded sampling of taxa and genes beyond previous analyses.

METHODS: We conducted two primary analyses based on 640 species representing 330 families. The first included 25260 aligned base pairs (bp) from 17 genes (representing all three plant genomes, i.e., nucleus, plastid, and mitochondrion). The second included 19846 aligned bp from 13 genes (representing only the nucleus and plastid).

KEY RESULTS: Many important questions of deep-level relationships in the nonmonocot angiosperms have now been resolved with strong support. Amborellaceae, Nymphaeales, and Austrobaileyales are successive sisters to the remaining angiosperms (Mesangiospermae), which are resolved into Chloranthales + Magnoliidae as sister to Monocotyledoneae + [Ceratophyllaceae + Eudicotyledoneae]. Eudicotyledoneae contains a basal grade subtending Gunneridae. Within Gunneridae, Gunnerales are sister to the remainder (Pentapetalae), which comprises (1) Superrosidae, consisting of Rosidae (including Vitaceae) and Saxifragales; and (2) Superasteridae, comprising Berberidopsidales, Santalales, Caryophyllales, Asteridae, and, based on this study, Dilleniaceae (although other recent analyses disagree with this placement). Within the major subclades of Pentapetalae, most deep-level relationships are resolved with strong support.

CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses confirm that with large amounts of sequence data, most deep-level relationships within the angiosperms can be resolved. We anticipate that this well-resolved angiosperm tree will be of broad utility for many areas of biology, including physiology, ecology, paleobiology, and genomics.},

A large and highly significant majority of island populations have less allozyme genetic variation than their mainland counterparts (165 of 202 comparisons), the average reduction being 29 per cent. The magnitude of differences was related to dispersal ability. There were related differences for all the other measures. Island endemic species showed lower genetic variation than related mainland species in 34 of 38 cases. The proportionate reduction in genetic variation was significantly greater in island endemic than in nonendemic island populations in mammals and birds, but not in insects. Genetic factors cannot be discounted as a cause of higher extinction rates of island than mainland populations.},

abstract = {Hybridization between closely related lineages is a mechanism that might promote substantive changes in phenotypic traits of descendants, resulting in transgressive evolution. Interbreeding between divergent but morphologically similar lineages can produce exceptional phenotypes, but the potential for transgressive variation to facilitate long-term trait changes in derived hybrid lineages has received little attention. We compare pollinator-mediated selection on transgressive floral traits in both early-generation and derived hybrid lineages of the Piriqueta cistoides ssp. caroliniana complex. The bowl-shaped flowers of morphotypes in this complex have similar gross morphologies and attract a common suite of small insect pollinators. However, they are defined by significant differences in characters that generate pollinator interest and visitation, including floral area and petal separation. In common garden experiments, patterns of pollen deposition in early-generation recombinant hybrids indicate that Piriqueta's pollinators favour flowers with greater area and reduced petal separation. Changes in floral morphology in derived hybrid lineages are consistent with predictions from selection gradients, but the magnitude of change is limited relative to the range of transgressive variation. These results suggest that hybridization provides variation for evolution of divergent floral traits. However, the potential for extreme transgressive variants to contribute to phenotypic shifts may be limited due to reduced heritability, evolutionary constraints or fitness trade-offs.},

From the intersection of these two premises follows the prediction that reproductive isolation can evolve on ecological time-scales. We explore this possibility in theory and in nature. Finding few relevant studies, we examine each in some detail. 2. Theory: Several models have demonstrated that ecological differences can drive the evolution of partial reproductive barriers in dozens to hundreds of generations. Barriers likely to evolve quickly include dispersal rate, habitat preference and selection against migrants/hybrids. 3. Plants: Adjacent populations adapting to different fertilizer treatments or to mine tailings can develop reproductive barriers within at least 100 generations. These barriers include differences in flowering time and selection against migrants/hybrids. 4. Invertebrates: Populations on native and introduced host plants can manifest reproductive barriers in dozens to hundreds of generations. These barriers include local host preference and selection against migrants/hybrids. 5. Vertebrates: Salmon adapting to divergent breeding environments can show restricted gene flow within at least 14 generations. Birds evolving different migratory routes can mate assortatively within at least 10–20 generations. Hybrid sculpins can become isolated from their ancestral species within at least 20–200 generations. 6. Ecological speciation can commence within dozens of generations. How far it goes is an important question for future research.},

abstract = {1. Corolla shape is one of many floral traits used by pollinators when making foraging decisions. Corolla shape has been implicated as a factor in floral isolation and evolutionary shifts between pollinator affinities, yet few studies have investigated how quantifiable differences in corolla shape affect pollinator behaviour. 2. This study measured variation in corolla shape (primarily corolla limb dissectedness) across eight species of Nicotiana (section Alatae) and its influence on flower choice by nocturnal hawkmoths (Manduca sexta). Behavioural assays performed under simulated moonlight tested for hawkmoth preference and performance differences between the average floral shape of sphingophilous species (CHawkmoth), the average of all Nicotiana species in this study (CAll), and/or the average of hummingbird-pollinated species (CHummingbird). 3. In mixed arrays, hawkmoths preferred CHawkmoth over CAll flowers, but only when shapes were not standardized for surface area. In homogeneous arrays, hawkmoths emptied more flowers with CHawkmoth shapes, but performance did not differ when shapes were standardized by surface area. However, hawkmoths visited fewer CHummingbird flowers than other shapes when surface area was standardized. 4. Our study shows that hawkmoth behaviour can be affected by differences in corolla shape, but that floral size may be more important than true shape differences in floral discrimination by hawkmoths.},

abstract = {Cyanogenic glycosides (CNglcs) are bioactive plant products derived from amino acids. Structurally, these specialized plant compounds are character- ized as $\alpha$-hydroxynitriles (cyanohydrins) that are stabilized by glucosylation. In recent years, improved tools within analytical chemistry have greatly in- creased the number of known CNglcs by enabling the discovery of less abundant CNglcs formed by additional hydroxylation, glycosylation, and acylation reactions. Cyanogenesis—the release of toxic hydrogen cyanide from endogenous CNglcs—is an effective defense against generalist herbi- vores but less effective against fungal pathogens. In the course of evolution, CNglcs have acquired additional roles to improve plant plasticity, i.e., estab- lishment, robustness, and viability in response to environmental challenges. CNglc concentration is usually higher in young plants, when nitrogen is in ready supply, or when growth is constrained by nonoptimal growth condi- tions. Efforts are under way to engineer CNglcs into some crops as a pest controlmeasure, whereas in other crops efforts are directed toward their re- moval to improve food safety.Given that many food crops are cyanogenic, it is important to understand themolecularmechanisms regulating cyanogen- esis so that the impact of future environmental challenges can be anticipated.},

abstract = {Male frogs call to attract females for mating and to defend territories from rival males. Female frogs of some species prefer lower-pitched calls, which indicate larger, more experienced males. Acoustic interference occurs when background noise reduces the active distance or the distance over which an acoustic signal can be detected. Birds are known to call at a higher pitch or frequency in urban noise, decreasing acoustic interference from low-frequency noise. Using Bayesian linear regression, we investigated the effect of traffic noise on the pitch of advertisement calls in two species of frogs, the southern brown tree frog (Litoria ewingii) and the common eastern froglet (Crinia signifera). We found evidence that L. ewingii calls at a higher pitch in traffic noise, with an average increase in dominant frequency of 4.1 Hz/dB of traffic noise, and a total effect size of 123 Hz. This frequency shift is smaller than that observed in birds, but is still large enough to be detected by conspecific frogs and confer a significant benefit to the caller. Mathematical modelling predicted a 24{\%} increase in the active distance of a L. ewingii call in traffic noise with a frequency shift of this size. Crinia signifera may also call at a higher pitch in traffic noise, but more data are required to be confident of this effect. Because frog calls are innate rather than learned, the frequency shift demonstrated by L. ewingii may represent an evolutionary adaptation to noisy conditions. The phenomenon of frogs calling at a higher pitch in traffic noise could therefore constitute an intriguing trade-off between audibility and attractiveness to potential mates.},

abstract = {Taxonomic identification of benthic macroinvertebrates is critical to protocols used to assess the biological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. The time, expense, and inherent error rate of species-level morphological identifications has necessitated use of genus- or family-level identifications in most large, statewide bioassessment programs. Use of coarse-scale taxonomy can obscure signal about biological condition, particularly if the range of species tolerances is large within genera or families. We hypothesized that integration of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) barcodes (partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences) into bioassessment protocols would provide greater discriminatory ability than genus-level identifications and that this increased specificity could lead to more sensitive assessments of water quality and habitat. Analysis of DNA barcodes from larval specimens of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa collected as part of Maryland's Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) revealed similar to 2 to 3x as many DNA-barcode groups or molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) as morphologically identified genera. As expected, geographic distributions for several mOTUs were tighter than for the parent genus, but few mOTUs showed closer associations with water-quality variables or physical-habitat features than did the genus in which they belonged. The need for improved protocols for the consistent generation of DNA barcodes is discussed.},

abstract = {The role of pollinators in plant speciation and maintenance of species boundaries is dubious because most plant species are visited by several types of pollinators, and most pollinator species visit several species of plants. We investigated pollinator preferences and their efficacy as ethological isolation mechanisms between two interfertile species, Nicotiana alata and N. forgetiana and their F1 hybrids. Hawkmoths pollinate N. alata, while primarily hummingbirds and occasionally small hawkmoths visit N. forgetiana. F1 hybrids are easily produced in the greenhouse and although the species grow in similar habitats, hybrids have not been found in nature. In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, near where both species are found, experimental plots were studied containing both species, and both species plus F1 hybrids. In the mixed-species plots, hawkmoths showed a strong preference for N. alata. Hummingbirds were less common and only visited N. forgetiana. Hybrid seed was produced but plants made significantly fewer hybrid offspring than predicted by the frequency of interspecific pollinator movements. Nicotiana forgetiana was the seed parent of 97{\%} of the F1 offspring, suggesting an asymmetry in pollen delivery or postpollination processes. In plots containing F1 hybrids plus both parental species, hawkmoths preferred N. alata and undervisited the other two phenotypes, except that in the third plot they visited hybrids in proportion to the hybrid frequency. Hummingbirds strongly preferred N. forgetiana in all plots but also visited F1 hybrids in proportion to their frequency in the third plot. Overall, F1 hybrids were well pollinated and were frequently visited immediately before or after one of the parental species. Thus hybrids could facilitate gene flow between the parental species. We conclude that pollinator discrimination among species is strong but is an imperfect isolation mechanism, especially if hybrids are present.},

abstract = {Geographically separated populations can convergently adapt to the same selection pressure. Convergent evolution at the level of a gene may arise via three distinct modes. The selected alleles can (1) have multiple independent mutational origins, (2) be shared due to shared ancestral standing variation, or (3) spread throughout subpopulations via gene flow. We present a model-based, statistical approach that utilizes genomic data to detect cases of convergent adaptation at the genetic level, identify the loci involved and distinguish among these modes. To understand the impact of convergent positive selection on neutral diversity at linked loci, we make use of the fact that hitchhiking can be modeled as an increase in the variance in neutral allele frequencies around a selected site within a population. We build on coalescent theory to show how shared hitchhiking events between subpopulations act to increase covariance in allele frequencies between subpopulations at loci near the selected site, and extend this theory under different models of migration and selection on the same standing variation. We incorporate this hitchhiking effect into a multivariate normal model of allele frequencies that also accounts for population structure. Based on this theory, we present a composite-likelihood-based approach that utilizes genomic data to identify loci involved in convergence, and distinguishes among alternate modes of convergent adaptation. We illustrate our method on genome-wide polymorphism data from two distinct cases of convergent adaptation. First, we investigate the adaptation for copper toxicity tolerance in two populations of the common yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus We show that selection has occurred on an allele that has been standing in these populations prior to the onset of copper mining in this region. Lastly, we apply our method to data from four populations of the killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, that show very rapid convergent adaptation for tolerance to industrial pollutants. Here, we identify a single locus at which both independent mutation events and selection on an allele shared via gene flow, either slightly before or during selection, play a role in adaptation across the species' range.},

abstract = {DNA barcoding is a novel system designed to provide rapid, accurate, and automatable species identifications by using short, standardized gene regions as internal species tags. As a consequence, it will make the Linnaean taxonomic system more accessible, with benefits to ecologists, conservationists, and the diversity of agencies charged with the control of pests, invasive species, and food safety. More broadly, DNA barcoding allows a day to be envisioned when every curious mind, from professional biologists to schoolchildren, will have easy access to the names and biological attributes of any species on the planet. In addition to assigning specimens to known species, DNA barcoding will accelerate the pace of species discovery by allowing taxonomists to rapidly sort specimens and by highlighting divergent taxa that may represent new species. By augmenting their capabilities in these ways,DNAbarcoding offers taxonomists the opportunity to greatly expand, and eventually complete, a global inventory of lifes diversity. Despite the potential benefits of DNA barcoding to both the practitioners and users of taxonomy, it has been controversial in some scientific circles (Wheeler, 2004; Will and Rubinoff, 2004; Ebach and Holdredge, 2005;Will et al., 2005).Afew have even characterizedDNAbarcoding as being anti-taxonomy, arguing that its implementation will signal the death of a system 250 years in the making.We feel that this opposition stems from misconceptions about the DNA barcoding effort. As such, we welcome this opportunity to clarify both the rationale and potential impacts of DNA barcoding. In responding to this set of questions, we emphasize the multiple positive impacts of this approach for taxonomy and biodiversity science},

In large parts of the world and for the majority of species, data describing distributions are very scarce. Museums, private collections and the historical literature offer a vast source of information on distributions. Records of the occurrence of species from these sources are increasingly being captured in electronic databases and made available over the internet. These records may be very valuable in conservation efforts. However, there are a number of limitations with museum data. These limitations are dealt with in the first part of this review. Even if the limitations of museum data can be overcome, these data present a far-from-complete picture of the distributions of species. Species distribution models offer a means to extrapolate limited information in order to estimate the distributions of species over large areas. The second part of this paper reviews the challenges of developing species distribution models for use with museum data and describes some of the questions that species distribution models have been used to address. Given the rapidly increasing number of museum records of species occurrence available over the internet, a review of their usefulness in conservation and ecology is timely.},

The combination of these effects constitutes a challenge for both the survival and persistence of many native species, while also imposing altered selective regimes. Here, using 110 314 single nucleotide polymorphisms generated by restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, we investigated the genome-wide effects of urbanization on putative neutral and adaptive genomic diversity in a major insect pollinator, Bombus lapidarius, collected from nine German cities and nine paired rural sites. Overall, genetic differentiation among sites was low and there was no obvious genome-wide genetic structuring, suggesting the absence of strong effects of urbanization on gene flow. We nevertheless identified several loci under directional selection, a subset of which was associated with urban land use, including the percentage of impervious surface surrounding each sampling site. Overall, our results provide evidence of local adaptation to urbanization in the face of gene flow in a highly mobile insect pollinator.},

abstract = {Tolerance is the ability of plants to maintain fitness after experiencing herbivore damage. We investigated scarlet gilia tolerance to browsing in the framework of phenotypic plasticity using both an operational and candidate trait approach. Individuals from full-sib families were split into an artificial clipping treatment, a natural-damage treatment, or left as controls. We tested for genetic variation in tolerance by evaluating family x herbivory treatment interactions on fitness in a mixed model analysis of variance. In addition, we used selection analyses to assess the function of flowering phenology and compensatory regrowth (via branch production) as candidate tolerance traits. We found a strong detrimental fitness effect of browsing and considerable variation among sire half-sib families in levels of tolerance (25{\%} to 63{\%} of the fitness of controls). There was no evidence of overcompensation at either the population or family level and no additive genetic variation in operationally defined tolerance. Phenotypic selection analyses provide evidence that early flowering and compensatory regrowth function as tolerance characters. We found strong linear and correlational selection for early flowering and increased branch production for damaged plants and linear selection for apical dominance (reduced branchiness) and early flowering in control plants. Moreover, reduced phenological delay and increased plasticity in branch production were correlated with tolerance. We detected significant additive genetic variation in flowering phenology in both treatments and a positive genetic correlation between the phenology of control and damaged plants. We found significant additive genetic variation in branch production in undamaged and naturally damaged plants, but not in clipped plants. Damaged plants exhibited marginally significant additive genetic variance in fitness, although its heritability was very low (approximately 3.6{\%}). We failed to find additive genetic variation in the fitness of control plants. Our results suggest that tolerance traits are under herbivore-imposed natural selection in this population, but that responses to selection are limited by available genetic variation and selective constraints.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Culex pipiens L. is the most widespread mosquito vector in temperate regions. This species consists of two forms, denoted molestus and pipiens, that exhibit important behavioural and physiological differences. The evolutionary relationships and taxonomic status of these forms remain unclear. In northern European latitudes molestus and pipiens populations occupy different habitats (underground vs. aboveground), a separation that most likely promotes genetic isolation between forms. However, the same does not hold in southern Europe where both forms occur aboveground in sympatry. In these southern habitats, the extent of hybridisation and its impact on the extent of genetic divergence between forms under sympatric conditions has not been clarified. For this purpose, we have used phenotypic and genetic data to characterise Cx. pipiens collected aboveground in Portugal. Our aims were to determine levels of genetic differentiation and the degree of hybridisation between forms occurring in sympatry, and to relate these with both evolutionary and epidemiological tenets of this biological group. RESULTS: Autogeny and stenogamy was evaluated in the F1 progeny of 145 individual Cx. pipiens females. Bayesian clustering analysis based on the genotypes of 13 microsatellites revealed two distinct genetic clusters that were highly correlated with the alternative traits that define pipiens and molestus. Admixture analysis yielded hybrid rate estimates of 8-10{\%}. Higher proportions of admixture were observed in pipiens individuals suggesting that more molestus genes are being introgressed into the pipiens form than the opposite. CONCLUSION: Both physiological/behavioural and genetic data provide evidence for the sympatric occurrence of molestus and pipiens forms of Cx. pipiens in the study area. In spite of the significant genetic differentiation between forms, hybridisation occurs at considerable levels. The observed pattern of asymmetric introgression probably relates to the different mating strategies adopted by each form. Furthermore, the differential introgression of molestus genes into the pipiens form may induce a more opportunistic biting behaviour in the latter thus potentiating its capacity to act as a bridge-vector for the transmission of arboviral infections.},

abstract = {When males of the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneur, are crossed to females of its close relative T. freemrani, the sex ratio of the hybrids is female biased, owing in part to hybrid male mortality. Morphological abnormalities are also frequent in the surviving hybrid males, but not in the hybrid females. The finding that the heterogametic sex (male) is more adversely affected in interspecific crosses than the homogametic sex is consistent with Haldane's rule, which predicts that hybrid dysfunction should emerge as an indirect byproduct of divergent adaptation to differing environments. If so, environmental effects and genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI) should characterize the expression of Haldane's rule and interspecific hybrid traits in general. We used two wild-collected populations of T. castaneum (from Infantes, Spain, and Madagascar) to investigate the effects of environmental variation on the ex- pression of Haldane's rule. Males from each population were mated to several T. freemani females and the half-sibling hybrid progenies were reared across a series of temperature regimes. For both populations, we found that hybrids raised at higher temperatures exhibited a more extreme expression of Haldane's rule: The hybrid sex ratios were more biased toward females and hybrid males had a much higher incidence of morphological abnormalities. The average response to temperature, the norm of reaction for Haldane's rule, varied between the two populations, and we found considerable and significant GEI for both hybrid traits within both populations. The evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed in the context of speciation arising as an indirect effect of local adaptation. },

abstract = {Adaptation often proceeds from standing variation, and natural selection acting on pairs of populations is a quantitative continuum ranging from parallel to divergent. Yet, it is unclear how the extent of parallel genetic evolution during adaptation from standing variation is affected by the difference in the direction of selection between populations. Nor is it clear whether the availability of standing variation for adaptation affects progress toward speciation in a manner that depends on the difference in the direction of selection. We conducted a theoretical study investigating these questions and have two primary findings. First, the extent of parallel genetic evolution between two populations rapidly declines as selection changes from fully parallel toward divergent, and this decline is steeper in organisms with more traits (i.e., greater dimensionality). This rapid decline happens because small differences in the direction of selection greatly reduce the fraction of alleles that are beneficial in both populations. For example, populations adapting to optima separated by an angle of 33° might have only 50{\%} of potentially beneficial alleles in common. Second, relative to when adaptation is from only new mutation, adaptation from standing variation improves hybrid fitness under parallel selection and reduces hybrid fitness under divergent selection. Under parallel selection, genetic parallelism from standing variation reduces the phenotypic segregation variance in hybrids, thereby increasing mean fitness in the parental environment. Under divergent selection, larger pleiotropic effects of alleles fixed from standing variation cause maladaptive transgressive phenotypes when combined in hybrids. Adaptation from standing genetic variation therefore slows progress toward speciation under parallel selection and facilitates progress toward speciation under divergent selection.},

Inflorescences larger than this opti- mum size for pod production may have particular selective value in con- tributing pollinia to other plants. The balance between the high-cost (per fruit), low-risk strategy of producing small inflorescences for pod production and the low-cost (per set of pollinia), high-risk strategy of large inflorescences for increasing pollinia production is probably adaptive. The partitioning of flowers among separate inflorescences permits an increase of pod production and may provide advantages from the tem- poral dispersion of blooming.},

In contrast, numerous workers have suggested that hybrid genotypes might demonstrate higher relative fitness under various environmental settings. Of particular importance in deciding between these opposing hypotheses are long-term analyses coupling ecological and genetic information. Although currently rare, such analyses have provided a test of the fitness of hybrid genotypes across generations and habitats and their role in adaptation and speciation.

abstract = {When two diverging species begin hybridizing, selection against hybridization is likely driven not by single substitutions, but by interactions between incompatible mutations. To identify these incompatibilities in natural populations, researchers examine the extent of non-random associations between ancestry at physically unlinked loci in admixed populations. In this approach, which we call "AD scans", locus-pairs with significantly positive "ancestry disequilibrium" (AD, i.e. locus-pairs that positively covary by ancestry) represent incompatible alleles. Past research has uniformly revealed an excess of locus-pairs with significantly positive AD, suggesting that dozens to hundreds of incompatibilities separate species. With forward simulations, we show that many realistic demographic scenarios, including recent and/or ongoing contact, generate a bias towards positive ancestry disequilibrium. We suggest steps that researchers can take to avoid pitfalls in interpreting AD scans, and present a novel measure of AD, which minimizes but does not fully eliminate bias in the AD distribution. We also show, by simulation, that the tail of the AD distribution is enriched for true incompatibilities. To illustrate the potential power and appropriate caution in interpretation of AD scans, we reanalyze previously published data from two admixed populations of Xiphophorus fishes. Our results imply that the prevalence of positive LD in admixed populations does not in itself support the idea that two-locus incompatibilities are widespread, but the co-enrichment of top AD hits across the two Xiphophorus populations supports the idea that AD scans can identify candidate interspecific incompatibilities.

abstract = {We develop a model to predict the increase in genetic variance of a quantitative character in a hybrid population produced by crossing two previously isolated populations of the same species. The increase in variance in the F-2 hybrids, the 'segregation variance', is caused by differences in the average allelic effects at each locus and by linkage disequilibrium among loci. We focus on the case in which the character is additively based and the average value of the character does not differ in the two populations. In that case the predicted segregation variance depends strongly on what is assumed about the genetic basis of the character. If the genetic variance of the character in each population is attributable to loci with numerous alleles of small effect that are in moderate frequency, as in Lande's (1975) model. the segregation variance should increase linearly with time since the populations were isolated, at a rate determined by the inverse of the effective population size. If the genetic variance is attributable to loci with alleles in very low frequency, as in Turelli's (1984) house-of-cards model or in Barton's (1990) model of pleiotropic, deleterious alleles, then the segregation variance in the hybrid population increases at a much lower rate},

abstract = {The formation of hybrid zones between nascent species is a widespread phenomenon. The evolutionary consequences of hybridization are influenced by numerous factors, including the action of natural selection on quantitative trait variation. Here we examine how the genetic basis of floral traits of two species of Louisiana Irises affects the extent of quantitative trait variation in their hybrids. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was used to assess the size (magnitude) of phenotypic effects of individual QTL, the degree to which QTL for different floral traits are colocalized, and the occurrence of mixed QTL effects. These aspects of quantitative genetic variation would be expected to influence (1) the number of genetic steps (in terms of QTL substitutions) separating the parental species phenotypes; (2) trait correlations; and (3) the potential for transgressive segregation in hybrid populations. Results indicate that some Louisiana Iris floral trait QTL have large effects and QTL for different traits tend to colocalize. Transgressive variation was observed for six of nine traits, despite the fact that mixed QTL effects influence few traits. Overall, our QTL results imply that the genetic basis of floral morphology and color traits might facilitate the maintenance of phenotypic divergence between Iris fulva and Iris brevicaulis, although a great deal of phenotypic variation was observed among hybrids.},

abstract = {One signature of adaptive radiation is a high level of trait change early during the diversification process and a plateau toward the end of the radiation. Although the study of the tempo of evolution has historically been the domain of paleontologists, recently developed phylogenetic tools allow for the rigorous examination of trait evolution in a tremendous diversity of organisms. Enemy-driven adaptive radiation was a key prediction of Ehrlich and Raven's coevolutionary hypothesis [Ehrlich PR, Raven PH (1964) Evolution 18:586-608], yet has remained largely untested. Here we examine patterns of trait evolution in 51 North American milkweed species (Asclepias), using maximum likelihood methods. We study 7 traits of the milkweeds, ranging from seed size and foliar physiological traits to defense traits (cardenolides, latex, and trichomes) previously shown to impact herbivores, including the monarch butterfly. We compare the fit of simple random-walk models of trait evolution to models that incorporate stabilizing selection (Ornstein-Ulenbeck process), as well as time-varying rates of trait evolution. Early bursts of trait evolution were implicated for 2 traits, while stabilizing selection was implicated for several others. We further modeled the relationship between trait change and species diversification while allowing rates of trait evolution to vary during the radiation. Species-rich lineages underwent a proportionately greater decline in latex and cardenolides relative to species-poor lineages, and the rate of trait change was most rapid early in the radiation. An interpretation of this result is that reduced investment in defensive traits accelerated diversification, and disproportionately so, early in the adaptive radiation of milkweeds.},

@misc{Ebach2005,
abstract = {Viewpoint DNA barcoding is a term used to describe efforts to use the mitochondrial COI (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) gene as a molecular marker to allow easier and more efficient identification of specimens of known and unknown species. The Web sites of international barcoding projects (Barcode of Life, www.barcoding life.org; Consortium for the Barcode of Life CBOL, http://barcoding.si.edu/index detail.htm) herald the techniques potential, informing readers that DNA barcoding will revolutionize the task of identification of species, allowing the identification of not only fragmentary specimens (a valuable application, without doubt) but also new species. The barcoding organizations further note that taxonomists have identified only about 15 percent of all living species over the past 250 years, and imply that the rapid loss of biodiversity worldwide adds urgency to their task. Large-scale barcoding will drastically accelerate the rate of species identification, according to the techniques champions. They assure readers that this work can be carried out by a cadre of technicians who need none of the high-level expertise of present-day taxonomists. DNA barcoding is thus portrayed as a way of counting all the species in the world, in the hope of knowing something more about biodiversity. This kind of hype often surrounds the development of new techniques. Over a decade ago, Francis Collins, the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, described the mapping of the human genome as the most important and the most significant project that humankind has ever mounted(Kolata 1993). But after that project was finished in 2001, geneticists began admitting what they could have known earlierthat, as Sydney Brenner wrote in a 2003 editorial in Science, we now know that the genome sequence is only the beginning and that a deduced amino acid sequence is not a target for anything unless we know how it participates in the physiological processes in our bodies (Brenner 2003). Sequence data do not tell you much about genes unless you can put them in a context. And thats the problem with the hype about DNA barcoding: it confuses gathering molecular information with meaningful knowledge. We made this argument in a recent letter published in Nature (Ebach and Holdrege 2005). David Schindel, executive secretary of CBOL, and Scott Miller, its chairman, replied, Ebach and Holdrege 2005 are correct in stating DNA barcoding generates information, not knowledge. CBOL believes that this information can make systematists and the consumers of taxonomic information more knowledgeable. Therein lies its potential value (Schindel and Miller 2005). But systematists do not, merely by generating information, become more knowledgeable. In fact, the reverse is the case: DNA barcoding will provide meaningful information only if scientists can place it within the context of rich morphological, physiological, and behavioral knowledge. As a technique that generates information, barcoding will provide new illustrations of what we already know well: life is complex. But that information needs to be put into context to be useful. There is a real danger that a one-sided barcoding effort will lead to a glut of undigested facts, keeping many minds and machines busy while diverting attention from the real taxonomic issues that a new technique cannot address. Any call for barcoding demands an even more forceful call for intensified efforts to increase biologists in-depth morphological and ecological understanding of Earths organisms. Imagine, for the sake of argument, that barcoders were able to tag each known taxonomic species with a DNA barcode, and that they discovered new and unique sequences that might indicate a hitherto unknown species. Since barcoders maintain that there exist DNA species that are impossible to tell apart from known species except through sequence comparisons, many new species identified by barcoding would not be morphologically distinguishable. The resulting,much larger number of species would be a number that means very little.What that number might tell us about actually existing species would have to be intensively investigated, because barcodes cannot reveal the types of their corresponding real species, those species relationships, or their behavior. In the end, we will be left with a very large and arbitrary number of supposed species. Since barcoding does not classify or create readily usable knowledge, it remains simply a technique, and should not be taken for more than that.What science really needs is more naturalists and taxonomists, not more barcoders. The CBOL Web site claims that DNA barcoding is a new and exciting addition to the taxonomists toolbox. The observation prompts a question: What is already in a taxonomists toolbox? It contains physical toolssuch as a checklist, microscope, net, and plant pressand years of training and experience gained from studying the taxonomy of one or more groups. If barcoding could be viewed and managed as one subordinate physical instrument to be implemented in specific instances, it would be a useful addition.The question, in the present climate of hightech hype, is whether researchers will realize that barcoding cannot replace any of the already existing tools, especially detailed knowledge of organisms. This is not a casual concern: wherever one looks in biology, molecular techniques are replacing the study of whole organisms and their relationships. We can envision the potential usefulness of DNA barcoding to the conservation ecologist and environmental consultant more easily than we can imagine its value to taxonomy. Barcoding could indeed be valuable in allowing quick species identification for rapid environmental assessment. It could, for example, help in allowing a rapid survey of the biodiversity in a polluted lake, or in a planned development site near an environmentally sensitive area. But even in these cases, a field guide, rubber boots, and a pair of binoculars are still perhaps the best and least invasive tools for identifying larger species. Barcoding would need specimens to be caught and possibly destroyed to provide cells whose DNA could be sequenced. Museums, herbaria, and other institutions linked to taxonomy are pushing for a worldwide barcoding initiative, one that will fund a whole generation of technicians to sequence one barcode for each specimen in a type collection.The funding drive comes at a time when taxonomy is suffering from a shortage of funds and taxonomists. Barcoding supporters such as T. Ryan Gregory state that the most unfortunate misunderstanding is that DNA barcoding competes with taxonomy for funding. Existing DNA barcoding networks have been funded by agencies that do not have a tradition of supporting taxonomic work. A global DNA barcoding initiative would be a big science programme, and as such would compete for priority with projects of similar scale from physics, medicine and genomicsnot taxonomy (Gregory 2005). Yet, if DNA barcoding receives major funding as a high-output, big science program, and as a result is viewed (wrongly) as a modernized taxonomy, it will in fact begin supplanting taxonomic projects. It is naive to believe that the drive toward universal barcoding will not bring with it a radical shift in overall funding priorities. Museums fortunate enough to acquire funding for barcoding will place emphasis on building molecular biology laboratories, employing technicians, and expanding laboratory space dedicated to molecular techniques. Will there still be adequate funding to expand collections, to support research that identifies and describes new species, or to pursue systematic work in classification and the development of new keys? Most important, will there be funding for new taxonomic positions? The role of museums, it should be remembered, is to further knowledge of life on Earth. They employ taxonomists who make discoveries in systematics, phylogenetics, physiology, ethnology, ecology, and biogeography.Museums will be unable to fulfill this role if they increasingly dedicate time, effort, and resources to molecular laboratories and barcode technicians. In a funding climate focused on promoting sexy new high-output solutions to global problems, a scientific field that progresses by investing much time, energy, and funding into training taxonomists, doing careful fieldwork, and carrying out detailed morphological studies may seem outmoded. According to this view, taxonomists soon will become fossils in the strata of scientific evolution themselves. They must avoid this fate by promoting taxonomy for what it really isbig science. If they took this step, taxonomists could propose major funding initiatives for taxonomy, and so perhaps eliminate the need for barcoding consortiums (Wheeler 2004). It is ironic that DNA barcoding is often portrayed as central to the effort to protect biodiversity. The implication seems to be that only enormous numbers of cataloged species, each with its own unique mitochondrial DNA sequence, will motivate human beings to gain, at last, respect for life. But this approach tells us next to nothing about the creatures we are supposed to care about.Would it not make much more sense to invest resources in getting to know better the whole organisms and their ecologies?

The albedo difference for channel 1 (visible) between St. Louis and a typical rural area was - 16{\%}, much larger than urban-rural albedo differences found in previous studies under snow-free conditions. The albedo difference between channel 1 and channel 2 (near-infrared) appears to be a better indicator of the snow boundary than either channel alone. The channel 4 (11 ??m) equivalent blackbody temperature difference between the warmest part of St. Louis and a typical rural area was 3 K during the day and 2.5 K at night, about the same as urban-rural temperature differences found under snow-free conditions. Day-night temperature differences were nearly the same in urban as in rural areas. Largest day-night differences were found in forested portions of the snow-covered area. Slightly larger (about 0.5 K) day-night differences were observed in the commercial-industrial area of St. Louis than in the residential area. This may be caused by residential heating. Finally, hot industrial targets were easily observed in 3.7 ??m images. These targets may be useful for accurate registration of AVHRR images. ?? 1987.},

We employed multitrait composite interval mapping to determine the number, effect, and degree of pleiotropy in quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting divergence in floral, vegetative, and life-history characters. We detected 16 QTL affecting floral traits; 7 affecting vegetative traits; and 5 affecting selected floral, vegetative, and life-history traits. Floral and vegetative traits are clearly polygenic. We detected a few major QTL, with all remaining QTL of small effect. Most detected QTL are pleiotropic, implying that the evolutionary shift between these annual and perennial populations is constrained. We also compared the genetic architecture controlling floral trait divergence both within (our intraspecific study) and between species, on the basis of a previously published analysis of M. guttatus and M. nasutus. Eleven of our 16 floral QTL map to approximately the same location in the interspecific map based on shared, collinear markers, implying that there may be a shared genetic basis for floral divergence within and among species of Mimulus.},

Following Gillespie (1983, 1984, 1991), I consider a population presently fixed for the ith best allele at a locus and study the sequential substitution of favorable mutations that results in fixation of the fittest DNA sequence locally available. Given a wild type sequence that is less than optimal, I derive the fitness rank of the next allele typically fixed by natural selection as well as the mean and variance of the jump in fitness that results when natural selection drives a substitution. Looking over the whole series of substitutions required to reach the best allele, I show that the mean fitness jumps occurring throughout an adaptive walk are constrained to a twofold window of values, assuming only that adaptation begins from a reasonably fit allele. I also show that the first substitution and the substitution of largest effect account for a large share of the total fitness increase during adaptation. I further show that the distribution of selection coefficients fixed throughout such an adaptive walk is exponential (ignoring mutations of small effect), a finding reminiscent of that seen in Fisher's geometric model of adaptation. Last, I show that adaptation by natural selection behaves in several respects as the average of two idealized forms of adaptation, perfect and random.},

abstract = {Hybrids between species are often sterile or inviable. This form of reproductive isolation is thought to evolve via the accumulation of mutations that interact to reduce fitness when combined in hybrids. Mathematical formulations of this “Dobzhansky–Muller model” predict an accelerating buildup of hybrid incompatibilities with divergence time (the “snowball effect”). Although the Dobzhansky–Muller model is widely accepted, the snowball effect has only been tested in two species groups. We evaluated evidence for the snowball effect in the evolution of hybrid male sterility among subspecies of house mice, a recently diverged group that shows partial reproductive isolation. We compared the history of subspecies divergence with patterns of quantitative trait loci (QTL) detected in F2 intercrosses between two pairs of subspecies (Mus musculus domesticus with M. m. musculus and M. m. domesticus with M. m. castaneus). We used a recently developed phylogenetic comparative method to statistically measure the fit of these data to the snowball prediction. To apply this method, QTL were partitioned as either shared or unshared in the two crosses. A heuristic partitioning based on the overlap of QTL confidence intervals produced unambiguous support for the snowball effect. An alternative approach combining data among crosses favored the snowball effect for the autosomes, but a linear accumulation of incompatibilities for the X chromosome. Reasoning that the X chromosome analyses are complicated by low mapping resolution, we conclude that hybrid male sterility loci have snowballed in house mice. Our study illustrates the power of comparative genetic mapping for understanding mechanisms of speciation.},

(ii) Empirical taxon-specific approaches are based on previously documented invasions of particular taxa. (iii) Evaluations of the biological characters of non-invasive taxa and successful invaders give rise either to general or to habitat-specific screening procedures. (iv) Evaluation of environmental compatibility helps to predict whether a particular plant taxon can invade specific habitats.

abstract = {Reciprocal crosses between species often display an asymmetry in the fitness of F1 hybrids. This pattern, referred to as isolation asymmetry or Darwin's corollary to Haldane's rule, is a general feature of reproductive isolation in plants, yet factors determining its magnitude and direction remain unclear. We evaluated reciprocal species crosses between two naturally hybridizing diploid species of Arabidopsis to assess the degree of isolation asymmetry at different postmating life stages. We found that pollen from Arabidopsis arenosa will usually fertilize ovules from Arabidopsis lyrata; the reverse receptivity being less complete. Maternal A. lyrata parents set more F1 hybrid seed, but germinate at lower frequency, reversing the asymmetry. As predicted by theory, A. lyrata (the maternal parent with lower seed viability in crosses) exhibited accelerated chloroplast evolution, indicating that cytonuclear incompatibilities may play a role in reproductive isolation. However, this direction of asymmetrical reproductive isolation is not replicated in natural suture zones, where delayed hybrid breakdown of fertility at later developmental stages, or later-acting selection against A. arenosa maternal hybrids (unrelated to hybrid fertility, e.g., substrate adaptation) may be responsible for an excess of A. lyrata maternal hybrids. Exogenous selection rather than cytonuclear incompatibilities thus shapes the asymmetrical postmating isolation in nature.},

Here, we present data from several crosses (parental crosses, F1, F2, and backcrosses) between the two host races of Lochmaea capreae on willow and birch to test for extrinsic isolation, intrinsic isolation, and environmentally dependent genetic incompatibilities. We employed a reciprocal transplant design in which offspring were raised on either host plant and their survival was recorded until adulthood. We also applied joint-scaling analysis to determine the genetic architecture of hybrid inviability. The relative fitness of the backcrosses switched between environments; furthermore, the additive genetic–environment interaction was detected as the strongest effect in our analysis. These results provide strong evidence that divergent natural selection has played a central role in the evolution of hybrid dysfunction between host races. Joint-scaling analysis detected significant negative epistatic effects that are most evident in the poor performance of F2-hybrids on willow, indicating signs of intrinsic isolation. We did not find any evidence that genetic incompatibilities are manifested independently of environmental conditions. Our findings suggest the outcome of natural hybridization between these host races is mainly affected by extrinsic isolation and a weak contribution of intrinsic isolation.},

This study tested this prediction using worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) foraging on inflorescences of Lavandula sroechns. Female flowers contained about twice the volume of nectar of male flowers. As one would predict, bees foraging for nectar only chose inflorescences with disproportionately more female flowers: time spent on the inflorescence was correlated with the number of female flowers, but not with the number of male flowers. Inflorescence size was inversely correlated with the number of female flowers, and could be used as a morphological cue by these bees. Also as predicted, workers foraging for both pollen and nectar chose inflorescences with relatively greater numbers of both male and female flowers: time spent on these inflorescences was correlated with the number of male flowers, but not with the number of females flowers. A morphological cue inversely associated with such inflorescences is the size of the bract display. Choice of flowers within inflorescences was also influenced predictably, but preferences appeared to be based upon corolla size rather than directly on sex phase.},

First, in one terrestrial and two aquatic experiments, decomposition varied twofold among tree types. Second, backcross hybrid leaves decomposed more slowly than those of either parent. Third, the variation in decomposition between F1 and backcross hybrids was as great as the variation between species. These results show significant differences in decomposition in a low-diversity system, where {\textgreater}80{\%} of the leaf litter comes from just two species and their hybrids. Mechanistically, high concentrations of condensed tannins in leaves appear to inhibit decomposition (r2=0.63). The initial condensed tannin concentration was high in narrowleaf leaves, low or undetectable in Fremont leaves, and intermediate in F1 hybrid leaves (additive inheritance). Backcross hybrids were high in condensed tannins and were not different from narrowleaf (dominant inheritance). Neither nitrogen (N) concentration nor the ratio of ash-free dry weight to N (a surrogate for carbon:nitrogen ratio) were significantly correlated with decomposition. The N content of leaf material at the end of each year's experiment was inversely correlated with rates of litter mass loss and varied 1.6- to 2.1-fold among tree classes. This result suggests that hybrids and their parental species are used differently by the microbial community.},

abstract = {Plants exhibit a number of adaptive defence traits that endow resistance to past and current abiotic and biotic stresses. It is generally accepted that these adaptations will incur a cost when plants are not challenged by the stress to which they have become adapted-the so-called 'cost of adaptation'. The need to minimise or account for allelic variation at other fitness-related loci (genetic background control) is frequently overlooked when assessing resistance costs associated with plant defence traits. We provide a synthesis of the various experimental protocols that accomplish this essential requirement. We also differentiate those methods that enable the identification of the trait-specific or mechanistic basis of costs (direct methods) from those that provide an estimate of the impact of costs by examining the evolutionary trajectories of resistance allele frequencies at the population level (indirect methods). The advantages and disadvantages for each proposed experimental design are discussed. We conclude that plant resistance systems provide an ideal model to address fundamental questions about the cost of adaptation to stress. We also propose some ways to expand the scope of future studies for further fundamental and applied insight into the significance of adaptation costs.},

A high level of pre-zygotic isolation had been maintained between the parental strains despite 3 years of laboratory rearing under identical conditions. The level of pre-zygotic isolation was reduced in matings with hybrids. There were also differences in other components of mating behaviour. There were quantitative and qualitative differences in the sex pheromone of the two strains with the hybrids producing a mixture. The pre-zygotic isolation barriers were complemented by high levels of post-zygotic inviability and sex ratio distortion, most likely not due to Wolbachia, although there was evidence of some cytoplasmic factor involved in sex ratio distortion. Analysis of polytene chromosomes revealed a high level of asynapsis in the hybrids, together with karyotypic differences between the parental strains.

In light of this recent shift, we present an evaluation of ecology's role in homoploid hybrid speciation, with an emphasis on the genetics underlying ecological components of the speciation process. We briefly review new theoretical developments related to the ecology of homoploid hybrid speciation; propose a set of explicit, testable questions that must be answered to verify the role of ecological selection in homoploid hybrid speciation; discuss published work with reference to these questions; and also report new data supporting the importance of ecological selection in the origin of the homoploid hybrid sunflower species Helianthus deserticola.

I report here that removal of nectar from flowers of Christmas bells (Blandfordia nobilis) increased the plant's net nectar production but reduced its ability to produce seeds. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that nectar production entails a cost to a plant in terms of growth and/or reproduction and that both the gains and costs associated with nectar production may be estimated in the same 'currency' (seeds). As a plant's nectar production increases, there should therefore be a trade-off between pollinator-mediated increases in numbers of fertilized seeds 1-3 and decreases in seed number due to the costs of producing the nectar.},

In cases of prezygotic reproductive isolation, candidate systems for speciation genes logically include genes involved in mate or gamete recognition. However, where only postzygotic isolation exists, candidate speciation genes could include any genes that affect hybrid performance. We hypothesize that because mitochondrial genes frequently evolve more rapidly than the nuclear genes with which they interact, interpopulation hybridization might be particularly disruptive to mitochondrial function. Understanding the potential impact of intergenomic (nuclear and mitochondrial) coadaptation on the evolution of allopatric populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus has required a broadly integrative research program; here we present the results of experiments spanning the spectrum of biological organization in order to demonstrate the consequences of molecular evolution on physiological performance and organismal fitness.

abstract = {Mate choice by phenotype matching, whereby individuals prefer a mate whose phenotype is similar to their own, should facilitate speciation with gene flow. This is because the genes that control mate signal (the phenotype being matched) also determine the preferred mate signal ("mate preference"). Speciation is made even easier if phenotype matching is based on a trait under divergent natural selection. In this case, assortative mating should readily evolve as a byproduct of divergent selection on the trait. Previous observational studies of assortative mating between sympatric, hybridizing threespine stickleback species (Gasterosteus aculeatus complex) suggested that phenotype matching might occur by body size, a trait under divergent natural selection. To test this, we used experimental manipulation of body size to rule out the effects of confounding variables.

It is thus likely that assortative mating by phenotype matching has facilitated the origin and persistence of benthic and limnetic threespine sticklebacks in the face of gene flow.},

abstract = {The proportion of cyanogenic individuals of white clover amongst 200 individuals in each of 32 neighbouring populations in Northumberland, UK were recorded. Sites differed for four altitude zones, two aspects, and were either sheep pasture or ungrazed meadow. The proportion of cyanogenics showed a striking reduction with increasing altitude. Below 100 m, north-facing sites contained more cyanogenics than south-facing sites, but aspect did not affect higher sites. Grassland management had no effect on the proportion of cyanogenics. A 24-year study of one population showed highly significant changes in the proportion of cyanogenics over time, suggesting that a significant turnover of individuals occurs. In some cases, different size class cohorts varied for the proportion of cyanogenics within a year, and the same cohort varied between years. We conclude that environment at birth may determine the proportion of cyanogenics for that cohort, so that this proportion persists in that cohort as it matures. Comparisons of the proportion of cyanogenics with mean monthly averages for January minimum temperature, July maximum temperature and August rainfall showed a significant association only with mean January minima 2 1/2 years previously. We hypothesise that the 2 to 3-year cohort may predominate in this population. We suggest that winter cold and summer drought may both select against cyanogenics. Grazing by large herbivores does not favour cyanogenesis, but some invertebrate herbivory may do so. Most selection probably occurs at birth and will be greatest in populations with a high turnover.},

Today's theoretical ecologists are extending this work to study the eco-evolutionary dynamics of multispecies communities and the functioning and evolutionary emergence of ecosystems. 3. In terms of methodology, eco-evolutionary modelling has diversified from simple, locus-based population genetic models to encompass models of clonal selection, quantitative trait dynamics and adaptive dynamics. 4. The few empirical studies on community dynamics that explicitly considered evolutionary processes support the view that evolutionary and ecological dynamics often occur on similar time-scales, and that they co-determine the dynamical behaviour of ecological communities.},

abstract = {Noise pollution is a world-wide phenomenon and its effects on animal behaviour have been investigated by numerous studies focusing mostly on vertebrate taxa. However, studying how insects are impacted by human-made noise is indispensable, because of their ecological importance and in order to gain a more comprehensive knowledge of how animals can cope with this new challenge. The few studies that have examined the effects of noise pollution on the acoustic signalling of insects have characterized noise over long timescales. In this study we examined whether males of the tree cricket Oecanthus pellucens modify their calling song in response to the fluctuation in traffic noise over a short timescale. To examine this question we carried out (1) noise level measurements over a short time window (200. ms) paired with song parameter measurements on sound recordings of males singing in their noise-polluted habitats and (2) laboratory playback experiments in which each singing male was recorded during a silent control period and during noise playback. Our results show that males shortened their calls (echemes) and paused singing with a higher probability with increasing noise level. However, males did not modify the fundamental frequency of their song and did not adjust the duration of the interecheme interval in response to noise. These results suggest that crickets decrease signalling effort during high levels of noise and, at least for the song parameters we examined, do not modify their signals, as do birds and frogs, to reduce masking by anthropogenic noise.},

In this review, I outline the causes and importance of this general phenomenon.

Correlations among traits associated with herbivory and pollination may constrain the degree to which plants can evolve in response to any one interactor. Using the distylous plant, Gelsemium sempervirens, we tested the hypothesis that traits typically associated with pollination (distyly) and herbivore resistance (secondary compounds) were phenotypically correlated and examined how these traits influenced plant interactions with floral visitors. The flowers of G. sempervirens are visited by pollinators and a nectar robber, and the leaves and flowers express gelsemine, an alkaloid that is deterrent and sometimes toxic to visitors. Using an observational approach across five populations, we found the thrum floral morph (short-styled) expressed more leaf gelsemine than the pin morph (long-styled). Leaf gelsemine concentrations were positively correlated with flower gelsemine; however, there were no correlations between gelsemine and other floral morphological traits. Trait expression influenced pollination more so than robbing. Thrums received two times less pollen than pins. Moreover, across both morphs, pollen receipt was lower in plants that expressed higher levels of leaf gelsemine in two sites. These results imply that traits associated with pollination and herbivore resistance may not be independent.},

Despite its recent success, several basic issues related to algorithm performance are still being debated. We assess the ability of two of the most popular algorithms, GARP and Maxent, to predict distributions when sampling is geographically biased. We use an extensive data set collected in the Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiversity hotspot in South America. We found that both algorithms give richness predictions that are very similar to other traditionally used richness estimators. Also, both algorithms correctly predicted the presence of most species collected during fieldwork, and failed to predict species collected only in very few cases (usually species with very few known localities, i.e., {\textless} 5). We also found that Maxent tends to be more sensitive to sampling bias than GARP. However, Maxent performs better when sampling is poor (e.g., low number of data points). Our results indicates that ENM, even when provided with limited and geographically biased localities, is a very useful technique to estimate richness and composition of unsampled areas. We conclude that data generated by ENM maximize the utility of existing biodiversity data, providing a very useful first evaluation. However, for reliable conservation decisions ENM data must be followed by well-designed field inventories, especially for the detection of restricted range, rare species.},

abstract = {Support for the theory of ecological speciation requires evidence for ecological divergence between species which directly or indirectly causes reproductive isolation. This study investigates effects of ecological vs. genetic disparity of parental species on the presence of endogenous selection (deformation and mortality rates) and potential sources of exogenous selection (growth rates and hatch timing) on hybrids. Hybrid embryonic development is analysed in a common-garden full-sib cross of three species belonging to two different ecotypes within the Coregonus lavaretus species flock in the central Alpine region of Europe. Although hatch timing was similar across the three species, embryonic growth rates and egg sizes differed between ecotypes. This led to a mismatch between embryonic growth rate and egg size in hybrid crosses that reveals epistasis between the maternal and embryonic genomes and transgressive hatch times that were asynchronous with control crosses. A strong constraint of egg size to embryo size at late development was also evident. We argue that this demonstrates potential for coadaptation of a maternal trait (egg size) with offspring growth rate to be an important source of selection against hybridization between ecotypes with different egg sizes. Implications for the measurement and quantification of early life-history traits affected by this additive relationship, such as hatch day and larval size, are also discussed.},

abstract = {The recombination that follows natural hybridization may produce hybrid genotypes with traits that are intermediate or extreme relative to the parental species, and these traits may influence the relative fitness of the hybrids. Here we examined leaf ecophysiological traits that may influence fitness patterns in a natural plant hybrid zone. We compared the biochemical photosynthetic capacity of Ipomopsis aggregata, I. tenuituba, and early generation hybrids, as well as their photosynthetic responses to varying light and temperature, two abiotic factors found to differ among sites along the hybrid zone. In general, ecophysiological traits expressed in these plants were consistent with their natural habitat, even when grown under common greenhouse conditions. I. tenuituba reached higher photosynthetic rates (A) at higher light levels than I. aggregata, and also had a higher optimal temperature for photosynthesis (Topt). This suite of traits may reflect adaptations to the more exposed, rocky sites where I. tenuituba is found, compared to the more vegetated, mesic I. aggregata site. Hybrids had characters that were largely intermediate or tenuituba-like, but particular individual hybrids were extreme for some traits, including light saturation level, light-saturated A, and Topt. Many of these traits are consistent with adaptations reported for plants found in warm, dry sites, so they may put certain hybrids at an advantage at the relatively xeric center of the natural hybrid zone.},

However, this metaphor, with its emphasis on adaptive peaks and valleys, is to a large degree a reflection of our three-dimensional experience. Both genotypes and phenotypes of biological organisms differ in numerous characteristics, and, thus, the dimension of 'real' adaptive landscapes is much larger than three. Properties of multidimensional adaptive landscapes are very different from those of low dimension. Consequently, something that is seen as a theoretical challenge in a low-dimensional case might be a trivial problem in a multidimensional context and vice versa. In particular, the problem of how a population crosses an adaptive valley on its way from one adaptive peak to another, which Wright attempted to solve with his shifting balance theory, may be non-existent. A new framework is emerging for deepening our understanding of evolution and speciation, which provides a plausible multidimensional alternative to the conventional view of rugged adaptive landscapes.},

abstract = {Abstract. The relationships between the distribution of alpine species and selected environmental variables are investigated by using two types of generalized linear models (GLMs) in a limited study area in the Valais region (Switzerland). The empirical relationships are used in a predictive sense to mimic the potential abundances of alpine species over a regular grid. Here, we present the results for the alpine sedge Carex curvula ssp. curvula. The modelling approach consists of (1) a binomial GLM, including only the mean annual temperature as explanatory variable, which is adjusted to species presence/absence data in the entire study area; (2) a logistic model restricted to stands occurring within the a priori defined temperature range for the species - which allows ordinal abundance data to be adjusted; (3) the two species-response functions combined in a GIS to generate a map of the species' potential abundance in the study area; (4) model predictions filtered by the classes of the qualitative variables under which the species never occur.Such a stratified approach used to better fit the variability within the optimal altitudinal zone for the species. Removing stand descriptions from altitudes too high or too low, where the species is unlikely to occur, enhances the global modelling performance by allowing the identification of important environmental variables only retained in the second model.The model evaluation is finally carried out with the {\^{I}}³-measure of association in an ordinal contingency table. It shows that abundance is satisfactorily predicted for C. curvula.},

abstract = {Much of the diversity of herbivorous insects stems from the adaptive divergence of populations onto different host plants. This often involves the evolution of specialized patterns of host acceptance that in turn lead to assortative mating for insects that mate exclusively on their hosts. Here, we explore the genetic architecture of feeding behavior in a herbivorous insect that has become a model for the study of incipient speciation, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). We use crosses between individuals specialized to either alfalfa or red clover in order to perform both a biometrical analysis and a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of key feeding behaviors. For each character in each environment, Castle-Wright's estimator for the number of effective factors segregating ranged from 0.11 to 2.54. Similarly, between 0 and 3 QTLs were detected. In one case, a single QTL explained over 50{\%} of the variance in the F2, suggesting that at least one gene (or a complex of tightly linked genes) has a major effect on feeding behavior in the pea aphid. However, the identified QTL explain only 23-73{\%} of the genetic variance for these characters thus additional genes of minor effect are also involved. We found a variety of modes of gene action, including several cases of non-additive gene action. Our results suggest that feeding behavior in pea aphids is neither simple nor highly polygenic. The oligogenetic basis of variation in feeding behavior may facilitate host shifts, providing one explanation for the frequent divergence and speciation of herbivorous insects.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:I. II. III. IV. V. VI. References$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY:Reproductive isolation in plants occurs through multiple barriers that restrict gene flow between populations, but their origins remain uncertain. Work in the past decade has shown that postpollination barriers, such as the failure to form hybrid seeds or sterility of hybrid offspring, are often less strong than prepollination barriers. Evidence implicates multiple evolutionary forces in the origins of reproductive barriers, including mutation, stochastic processes and natural selection. Although adaptation to different environments is a common element of reproductive isolation, genomic conflicts also play a role, including female meiotic drive. The genetic basis of some reproductive barriers, particularly flower colour influencing pollinator behaviour, is well understood in some species, but the genetic changes underlying many other barriers, especially pollen-stylar interactions, are largely unknown. Postpollination barriers appear to accumulate at a faster rate in annuals compared with perennials, due in part to chromosomal rearrangements. Chromosomal changes can be important isolating barriers in themselves but may also reduce the recombination of genes contributing to isolation. Important questions for the next decade include identifying the evolutionary forces responsible for chromosomal rearrangements, determining how often prezygotic barriers arise due to selection against hybrids, and establishing the relative importance of genomic conflicts in speciation.},

To assess the effectiveness and universality of these barcode markers in seed plants, we sampled 6,286 individuals representing 1,757 species in 141 genera of 75 families (42 orders) by using four different methods of data analysis. These analyses indicate that (i) the three plastid markers showed high levels of universality (87.1-92.7{\%}), whereas ITS performed relatively well (79{\%}) in angiosperms but not so well in gymnosperms; (ii) in taxonomic groups for which direct sequencing of the marker is possible, ITS showed the highest discriminatory power of the four markers, and a combination of ITS and any plastid DNA marker was able to discriminate 69.9-79.1{\%} of species, compared with only 49.7{\%} with rbcL + matK; and (iii) where multiple individuals of a single species were tested, ascriptions based on ITS and plastid DNA barcodes were incongruent in some samples for 45.2{\%} of the sampled genera (for genera with more than one species sampled). This finding highlights the importance of both sampling multiple individuals and using markers with different modes of inheritance.

abstract = {Genetic differentiation may exist among sympatric populations of a species due to long-term associations with alternative hosts (i.e. host-associated differentiation). While host-associated differentiation has been documented in several phytophagus insects, there are far fewer cases known in animal parasites. The bed bug, Cimex lectularius, a wingless insect, represents a potential model organism for elucidating the processes involved in host-associated differentiation in animal parasites with relatively limited mobility. In conjunction with the expansion of modern humans from Africa into Eurasia, it has been speculated that bed bugs extended their host range from bats to humans in their shared cave domiciles throughout Eurasia. C. lectularius that associate with humans have a cosmopolitan distribution, whereas those associated with bats occur across Europe, often in human-built structures. We assessed genetic structure and gene flow within and among populations collected in association with each host using mtDNA, microsatellite loci and knock-down resistance gene variants. Both nuclear and mitochondrial data support a lack of significant contemporary gene flow between host-specific populations. Within locations human-associated bed bug populations exhibit limited genetic diversity and elevated levels of inbreeding, likely due to human-mediated movement, infrequent additional introduction events per infestation, and pest control. In contrast, populations within bat roosts exhibit higher genetic diversity and lower levels of relatedness, suggesting populations are stable with temporal fluctuations due to host dispersal and bug mortality. In concert with previously published evidence of morphological and behavioural differentiation, the genetic data presented here suggest C. lectularius is currently undergoing lineage divergence through host association.},

abstract = {This study explored the genetic basis of phenotypic differences between two sympatric species of ecologically and morphologically divergent sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus complex). The aim was to understand how many loci determine the differences and to what extent the differences are due to additive or nonadditive gene action. I reared the two parental species, F1 and F2 hybrids, and both backcrosses in the laboratory and measured the following quantitative characters: gill raker number and length (both involved in feeding), lateral plate number and pelvic spine length (both involved in predator defense), and growth (a fitness component). I then applied joint-scaling regression models to estimate composite additive, dominance and epistatic effects, and their contribution to divergence of parental lines. A simple additive model was sufficient for gill raker number and growth; additive and dominance effects contributed significantly to divergence in plate number and pelvic spine length; and additive, dominance, and epistatic effects contributed significantly to divergence in gill raker length. Wright's estimator for the number of loci for the four morphological characters ranged from 1 to 50. My results suggest that adaptive divergence between limnetic and benthic sticklebacks has taken place through a variety of genetic mechanisms specific to different traits. Though interspecific hybrids are completely fertile and viable in the laboratory, they are selected against in the wild. The pattern of inheritance for the traits examined here directly influences how well hybrids can exploit the two major resource environments in the wild.},

abstract = {In many plants, defence systems against herbivores are induced through the octadecanoid pathway(1,2), which may also be involved in recruiting natural enemies of herbivores(3). This pathway can be induced by treating plants with jasmonic acid(4) or by natural herbivory, and increases resistance against herbivorous insects in tomato plants(5), in part by causing production of toxic and antinutritive proteinase inhibitors and oxidative enzymes(6-8). Herbivore-infested tomato plants release increased amounts of volatiles(9) and attract natural enemies of the herbivores(10), as do other plants(11-15). The octadecanoid pathway may regulate production of these volatiles, which attract host-seeking parasitic wasps(16,17). However, plant resistance compounds can adversely affect parasitoids as well as herbivores(18). It is unclear whether the combination of increased retention and/or attractiveness of parasitic wasps to induced plants and the adverse effects of plant defence compounds on both caterpillars and parasitoids results in a net increase in parasitization of herbivores feeding on induced plants. Here I show that inducing plants with jasmonic acid increases parasitism of caterpillar pests in an agricultural field twofold. Thus, elicitors of plant resistance may become useful in agriculture.},

Nodding thistle seeds inhibited germination of all species except subterranean clover in at least one of the bioassays used. Radicle elongation of all species was substantially inhibited in the presence of nodding thistle seeds both on filter paper and on soil. In soil systems, nodding thistle seeds inhibited radicle elongation of seeds over distances of up to 4-7 mm. A probability analysis demonstrated that a high density of nodding thistle seeds has the potential to exert a substantial negative effect on establishment of newly sown pasture. Nodding thistle seeds were either stimulated or largely unaffected by other seeds of their own species (except when seeds were touching) suggesting that the allelopathic potential of nodding thistle seeds may be an evolved mechanism to encourage establishment of thistle seedlings.},

Here, we review recent studies of the evolutionary consequences of species invasions, revealing abundant and widespread examples of exotic species promoting evolutionary diversification via increased genetic differentiation among populations of both exotic and native species and the creation of new hybrid lineages. Our review indicates that, although the well-documented reductions to biodiversity caused by exotic species might outweigh the increases resulting from diversification, a complete understanding of the net effects of exotic species on biodiversity in the long term will require consideration of both. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The role of alien species in urban vegetation is reviewed. Representation of aliens is compared with that of native species by taking into account both historical and spatial aspects. On a long-term time scale (more than a century), the importance of aliens, especially neophytes, is increasing. The representation of alien species, if expressed in quantitative terms, shows a close rela- tionship to the spatial structure of the city, and decreases from the city center towards the outskirts. In many cases, this trend is still valid at the level of particular species, as exemplified by an alien tree Ailanthus altissima. The relationship between species richness and the level of man-induced distur- bance supports the intermediate disturbance theory only if the native species are considered; aliens, both archaeophytes and neophytes, are encouraged in sites subjected to high disturbance levels. At the level of phytosociological alliances, the proportion of alien species was closely correlated with the disturbance level, although the relationship was rather variable between particular alliances. As regards the role of alien species in succession on urban waste land, it appears that alien species may persist as dominants in succession for a long period. The following factors promoting the success of alien species in urban environment are discussed: availability of specific urban niches, high level of disturbance in urban environment, and the minor isolation of seed sources.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In food-deceptive orchids of the genera Anacamptis, Neotinea and Orchis floral isolation has been shown to be weak, whereas late-acting reproductive barriers are mostly strong, often restricting hybridization to the F1 generation. Only in a few species hybridization extends beyond the F1 generation, giving rise to hybrid swarms. However, little is known about the abundance of later-generation hybrids and what factors drive their occurrence in hybrid populations. In this study, molecular analyses were combined with detailed morphological measurements in a hybrid population of two closely related Orchis species (Orchis militaris and O. purpurea) to investigate the hypothesis that the abundance of later-generation hybrids is driven by changes in floral characters after hybridization that exert selective pressures that in turn affect hybridization.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Both the molecular and morphological data point to extensive genetic and morphological homogenization and asymmetric introgression. Estimating genomic clines from the multi-locus genotype data and testing for deviation from neutrality revealed that 30 out of 113 (27{\%}) AFLP markers significantly deviated from neutral expectations. Plants with large floral displays or plant with flowers that resembled more O. purpurea had higher female fitness than plants with small floral displays or plants with flowers resembling more O. militaris, suggesting that directional selection may have contributed to the observed patterns of introgression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in closely related orchid species hybridization and gene introgression may be partly driven by selection for floral traits of one of the parental types. However, because some pure individuals were still present in the studied population, the parental species appeared to be sufficiently isolated to survive the challenge of sympatry.},

abstract = {Allopatric speciation may be the principal mechanism generating new species. Yet, it remains difficult to judge the generality of this process because few studies have provided evidence that geographic isolation has triggered the development of reproductive isolation over multiple species of a regional fauna. Here, we first combine results from new empirical data sets (7 taxa) and published literature (9 taxa) to show that the eastern Great Lakes drainage represents a multispecies suture zone for glacial lineages of freshwater fishes with variable levels of genetic divergence. Second, we performed amplified fragment length polymorphism analyses among four pairs of lineages. Results indicate that lineages with relatively deep levels of mtDNA 5' COI (barcode) sequence divergence ({\textgreater}2{\%}) developed strong reproductive barriers, while lineages with lower levels of divergence show weaker reproductive isolation when found in sympatry. This suggests that a threshold of 2{\%} sequence divergence at mtDNA could be used as a first step to flag cryptic species in North American freshwater fishes. By describing different levels of divergence and reproductive isolation in different co-occurring fishes, we offer strong evidence that allopatric speciation has contributed significantly to the diversification of north-eastern American freshwater fishes and confirm that Pleistocene glacial cycles can be viewed as a 'speciation pump' that played a predominant role in generating biodiversity.},

abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90{\%} of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25{\%} of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1{\%} of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24{\%} is in introns, with 75{\%} of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1{\%} of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

Although our understanding of the strength and form of selection has increased, a general understanding of the temporal dynamics of selection in nature is lacking. Here, we assembled a database of temporal replicates of selection from studies of wild populations to synthesize what we do (and do not) know about the temporal dynamics of selection. Our database contains 5519 estimates of selection from 89 studies, including estimates of both direct and indirect selection as well as linear and nonlinear selection. Morphological traits and studies focused on vertebrates were well-represented, with other traits and taxonomic groups less well-represented. Overall, three major features characterize the temporal dynamics of selection. First, the strength of selection often varies considerably from year to year, although random sampling error of selection coefficients may impose bias in estimates of the magnitude of such variation. Second, changes in the direction of selection are frequent. Third, changes in the form of selection are likely common, but harder to quantify. Although few studies have identified causal mechanisms underlying temporal variation in the strength, direction and form of selection, variation in environmental conditions driven by climatic fluctuations appear to be common and important.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, land-use and climate change have led to substantial range contractions and species extinctions. Even more dramatic changes to global land cover are projected for this century. We used the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios to evaluate the exposure of all 8,750 land bird species to projected land-cover changes due to climate and land-use change. For this first baseline assessment, we assumed stationary geographic ranges that may overestimate actual losses in geographic range. Even under environmentally benign scenarios, at least 400 species are projected to suffer {\textgreater}50{\%} range reductions by the year 2050 (over 900 by the year 2100). Although expected climate change effects at high latitudes are significant, species most at risk are predominantly narrow-ranged and endemic to the tropics, where projected range contractions are driven by anthropogenic land conversions. Most of these species are currently not recognized as imperiled. The causes, magnitude and geographic patterns of potential range loss vary across socioeconomic scenarios, but all scenarios (even the most environmentally benign ones) result in large declines of many species. Whereas climate change will severely affect biodiversity, in the near future, land-use change in tropical countries may lead to yet greater species loss. A vastly expanded reserve network in the tropics, coupled with more ambitious goals to reduce climate change, will be needed to minimize global extinctions.},

These findings reveal host-associated postmating isolation, although a nonecological, 'intrinsic' basis for these patterns cannot be ruled out. Host preference and performance results among cross types further suggest sex-linked maternal effects on these traits, whereas family effects indicate their genetic basis and associated variation. Genes of major effect appear to influence these traits. Together with previous findings of premating isolation and adaptive differentiation in sympatry, our results meet many assumptions of 'speciation with gene flow' models. Here, such gene flow is likely asymmetric, with consequences for the dynamics of future ecological divergence and potential ecological speciation of these host forms.},

abstract = {Adaptive divergence due to habitat differences is thought to play a major role in formation of new species. However it is rarely clear the extent to which individual reproductive isolating barriers related to habitat differentiation contribute to total isolation. Furthermore, it is often difficult to determine the specific environmental variables that drive the evolution of those ecological barriers, and the geographic scale at which habitat-mediated speciation occurs. Here, we address these questions through an analysis of the population structure and reproductive isolation between coastal perennial and inland annual forms of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus. We found substantial morphological and molecular genetic divergence among populations derived from coast and inland habitats. Reciprocal transplant experiments revealed nearly complete reproductive isolation between coast and inland populations mediated by selection against immigrants and flowering time differences, but not postzygotic isolation. Our results suggest that selection against immigrants is a function of adaptations to seasonal drought in inland habitat and to year round soil moisture and salt spray in coastal habitat. We conclude that the coast and inland populations collectively comprise distinct ecological races. Overall, this study suggests that adaptations to widespread habitats can lead to the formation of reproductively isolated species.},

abstract = {Ecological speciation with gene flow is widespread in nature [1], but it presents a conundrum: how are associations between traits under divergent natural selection and traits that contribute to assortative mating maintained? Theoretical models suggest that genetic mechanisms inhibiting free recombination between loci underlying these two types of traits (hereafter, “genetic coupling”) can facilitate speciation [2–4]. Here, we perform a direct test for genetic coupling by mapping both divergent traits and female mate choice in a classic model of ecological speciation: sympatric benthic and limnetic threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). By measuring mate choice in F2 hybrid females, we allowed for recombination between loci underlying assortative mating and those under divergent ecological selection. In semi-natural mating arenas in which females had access to both benthic and limnetic males, we found that F2 females mated with males similar to themselves in body size and shape. In addition, we found two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with female mate choice that also predicted female morphology along the benthic-limnetic trait axis. Furthermore, a polygenic genetic model that explains adaptation to contrasting benthic and limnetic feeding niches [5] also predicted F2 female mate choice. Together, these results provide empirical evidence that genetic coupling of assortative mating with traits under divergent ecological selection helps maintain species in the face of gene flow, despite a polygenic basis for adaptation to divergent environments. By testing the mate choice of benthic-limnetic stickleback F2 hybrid females in a semi-natural pond experiment, Bay et al. provide empirical evidence to support the long-standing theoretical prediction that genetic coupling between assortative mating and traits under divergent selection can facilitate speciation in the face of gene flow.},

abstract = {Research on suction-feeding performance has mostly focused on measuring individual underlying components such as suction pressure, flow velocity, ram or the effects of suction-induced forces on prey movement during feeding. Although this body of work has advanced our understanding of aquatic feeding, no consensus has yet emerged on how to combine all of these variables to predict prey-capture performance. Here, we treated the aquatic predator-prey encounter as a hydrodynamic interaction between a solid particle (representing the prey) and the unsteady suction flows around it, to integrate the effects of morphology, physiology, skull kinematics, ram and fluid mechanics on suction-feeding performance. We developed the suction-induced force-field (SIFF) model to study suction-feeding performance in 18 species of centrarchid fishes, and asked what morphological and functional traits underlie the evolution of feeding performance on three types of prey. Performance gradients obtained using SIFF revealed that different trait combinations contribute to the ability to feed on attached, evasive and (strain-sensitive) zooplanktonic prey because these prey types impose different challenges on the predator. The low overlap in the importance of different traits in determining performance also indicated that the evolution of suction-feeding ability along different ecological axes is largely unconstrained. SIFF also yielded estimates of feeding ability that performed better than kinematic traits in explaining natural patterns of prey use. When compared with principal components describing variation in the kinematics of suction-feeding events, SIFF output explained significantly more variation in centrarchid diets, suggesting that the inclusion of more mechanistic hydrodynamic models holds promise for gaining insight into the evolution of aquatic feeding performance.},

abstract = {A paradigm of evolutionary biology is that adaptation and reproductive isolation are caused by a nearly infinite number of mutations of individually small effect. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the genetic basis of pollinator discrimination in two closely related species of monkeyflowers that differ in their major pollinators. This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the genetic architecture of adaptation and speciation because floral traits that confer pollinator specificity also contribute to premating reproductive isolation. We asked: (i) What floral traits cause pollinator discrimination among plant species? and (ii) What is the genetic basis of these traits? We examined these questions by using data obtained from a large-scale field experiment where genetic markers were employed to determine the genetic basis of pollinator visitation. Observations of F2 hybrids produced by crossing bee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii with hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis revealed that bees preferred large flowers low in anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments, whereas hummingbirds favored nectar-rich flowers high in anthocyanins. An allele that increases petal carotenoid concentration reduced bee visitation by 80{\%}, whereas an allele that increases nectar production doubled hummingbird visitation. These results suggest that genes of large effect on pollinator preference have contributed to floral evolution and premating reproductive isolation in these monkeyflowers. This work contributes to growing evidence that adaptation and reproductive isolation may often involve major genes.},

abstract = {We discuss three interlinked issues: the natural pace of environmental change and adaptation, the likelihood that a population will adapt to a potentially lethal change, and adaptation to elevated CO2, the prime mover of global change. 1. Environmental variability is governed by power laws showing that ln differ- ence in conditions increases with ln elapsed time at a rate of 0.3–0.4. This leads to strong but fluctuating selection in many natural populations. 2. The effect of repeated adverse change on mean fitness depends on its fre- quency rather than its severity. If the depression of mean fitness leads to population decline, however, severe stress may cause extinction. Evolu- tionary rescue from extinction requires abundant genetic variation or a high mutation supply rate, and thus a large population size. Although natural populations can sustain quite intense selection, they often fail to adapt to anthropogenic stresses such as pollution and acidification and instead become extinct. 3. Experimental selection lines of algae show no specific adaptation to ele- vated CO2, but instead lose their carbon-concentrating mechanism through mutational degradation. This is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the oceanic carbon pump. Elevated CO2 is also likely to lead to changes in phytoplankton community composition, although it is not yet clear what these will be. We emphasize the importance of experimental evolution in understanding and predicting the biological response to global change. This will be one of the main tasks of evolutionary biologists in the coming decade.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Many previous studies conclude that pre-zygotic barriers such as mechanical isolation account for most reproductive isolation between pairs of taxa. However, the inheritance and persistence of barriers such as these after the first generation of hybridization is rarely quantified, even though it is a vital consideration in understanding gene flow potential. There is an asymmetrical pre-zygotic mechanical barrier to hybridization between Eucalyptus nitens and Eucalyptus globulus, which completely prevents small-flowered E. nitens pollen from mating with large E. globulus flowers, while the reverse cross is possible. We aimed to determine the relative importance of pre- and post-zygotic barriers in preventing gene flow following secondary contact between E. nitens and E. globulus, including the inheritance of barriers in advanced-generation hybrids. Methods: Experimental crossing was used to produce outcrossed E. nitens, E. globulus and their F1, F2, BCg and BCn hybrids. The strength and inheritance of a suite of pre- and post-zygotic barriers were assessed, including 20-year survival, growth and reproductive capacity. Key Results: The mechanical barrier to hybridization was lost or greatly reduced in the F1 hybrid. In contrast, intrinsic post-zygotic barriers were strong and persistent. Line-cross analysis indicated that the outbreeding depression in the hybrids was best explained by epistatic loss. Conclusions: The removal of strong mechanical barriers between E. nitens and E. globulus allows F1 hybrids to act as a bridge for bi-directional gene flow between these species. However, strong and persistent post-zygotic barriers exist, meaning that wherever F1 hybridization does occur, intrinsic post-zygotic barriers will be responsible for most reproductive isolation in this system. This potential transient nature of mechanical barriers to zygote formation due to additive inheritance in hybrids appears under-appreciated, and highlights the often important role that intrinsic post-mating barriers play in maintaining species boundaries at zones of secondary contact.

abstract = {One view of pollination systems is that they tend toward specialization. This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant-pollinator coevolution and in the long-standing concept of "pollination syndromes." But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest. To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in "phenotype space," there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior and morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the "correct" pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information-processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.},

abstract = {Conservationists are increasingly relying on distribution models to predict where species are likely to occur, especially in poorly-surveyed but biodiverse areas. Modeling is challenging in these cases because locality data necessary for model formation are often scarce and spatially imprecise. To identify methods best suited to modeling in these conditions, we compared the success of three algorithms (Maxent, Mahalanobis Typicalities and Random Forests) at predicting distributions of eight bird and eight mammal species endemic to the eastern slopes of the central Andes. We selected study species to have a range of locality sample sizes representative of the data available for endemic species of this region and also that vary in their distribution characteristics. We found that for species that are known from moderate numbers (N = 38–94) of localities, the three methods performed similarly for species with restricted distributions but Maxent and Random Forests yielded better results for species with wider distributions. For species with small numbers of sample localities (N = 5–21), Maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by Random Forests and then Mahalanobis Typicalities. Because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field. Overall, Maxent appears to be the most capable method for modeling distributions of Andean bird and mammal species because of the consistency of results in varying conditions, although the other methods have strengths in certain situations.},

abstract = {Divergent natural selection for efficient exploitation of alternative resources is thought to be a primary cause of adaptive radiation. I transplanted two recently diverged stickleback species (Gasterosteus sp.) and their Hybrids between habitats to test three predictions of this hypothesis: (1) the form of natural selection on feeding traits should differ between resource environments; (2) fitness trade-offs should occur between morphs specialized for different resources; (3) feeding efficiency should be the basis of fitness differences between morphs. Growth rate was used as a surrogate component of fitness. All three predictions were upheld. The larger of the two species (the Benthic), which has a larger mouth, deeper body, and fewer, shorter gill rakers than the second species (the Limnetic), had a twofold growth advantage in the littoral zone of the lake. This pattern was reversed in the open-water habitat, where the Limnetic species grew at double the rate of the Benthic. Hybrids, which are morphologically intermediate, tended to be intermediate in growth in both habitats. Growth rates were closely predicted by earlier laboratory measurements of feeding efficiency of the three forms in the same habitats, thus linking growth (and probably fitness) with feeding performance and morphology. I compare the strengths of the present approach with other methods that have been used to test the role of resources in adaptive radiation. I also argue that steep trade-offs in fitness along the littoral-open-water habitat gradient have two further consequences. First, they may cause Hybrids to have low fitness, allowing Benthics and Limnetics to coexist in the absence of perfect premating isolation between them. Second, they may promote ecological character displacement. Steep trade-offs may thus help explain why divergence along the littoral-open-water gradient is so common in fish that have colonized low-diversity lakes.},

The objective of this study was to identify and compare the differences in the starting dates of the pre-spring phenophases, the beginning of flowering of the snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) and forsythia (Forsythia sp.), and of the full-spring phenophases, the beginning of flowering of the sweet cherry (Prunus avium) and apple (Malus domestica), in urban and rural areas. The results indicate that, despite regional differences, in nearly all cases the species studied flower earlier in urbanised areas than in the corresponding rural areas. The forcing in urban areas was about 4 days for the pre-spring phenophases and about 2 days for the full-spring phenophases. The analysis of trends for the period from 1951 to 1995 showed tendencies towards an earlier flowering in all regions, but only 22{\%} were significant at the 5{\%} level. The trends for the period from 1980 to 1995 were much stronger for all regions and phases: the pre-spring phenophases on average became earlier by 13.9 days/decade in the urban areas and 15.3 days/decade in the rural areas, while the full-spring phenophases were 6.7 days earlier/decade in the urban areas and 9.1 days/decade earlier in the rural areas. Thus rural areas showed a higher trend towards an earlier flowering than did urban areas for the period from 1980 to 1995. However, these trends, especially for the pre-spring phenophases, turned out to be extremely variable.},

abstract = {The evolution of convergent phenotypes is one of the most interesting outcomes of replicate adaptive radiations. Remarkable cases of convergence involve the thick-lipped phenotype found across cichlid species flocks in the East African Great Lakes. Unlike most other convergent forms in cichlids, which are restricted to East Africa, the thick-lipped phenotype also occurs elsewhere, for example in the Central American Midas Cichlid assemblage. Here, we use an ecological genomic approach to study the function, the evolution and the genetic basis of this phenotype in two independent cichlid adaptive radiations on two continents. We applied phylogenetic, demographic, geometric morphometric and stomach content analyses to an African (Lobochilotes labiatus) and a Central American (Amphilophus labiatus) thick-lipped species. We found that similar morphological adaptations occur in both thick-lipped species and that the 'fleshy' lips are associated with hard-shelled prey in the form of molluscs and invertebrates. We then used comparative Illumina RNA sequencing of thick vs. normal lip tissue in East African cichlids and identified a set of 141 candidate genes that appear to be involved in the morphogenesis of this trait. A more detailed analysis of six of these genes led to three strong candidates: Actb, Cldn7 and Copb. The function of these genes can be linked to the loose connective tissue constituting the fleshy lips. Similar trends in gene expression between African and Central American thick-lipped species appear to indicate that an overlapping set of genes was independently recruited to build this particular phenotype in both lineages.},

abstract = {A survey of the agricultural and evolutionary literature was undertaken to determine the extent to which phenotypic correlations reflect their genetic counterparts in plants. More than 4000 phenotypic and genetic correlations representing 27 different plant species and over 40 years of research were analysed. In 74 per cent of the comparisons, the arrangement of elements of different magnitudes in genetic and phenotypic correlation matrices was more similar than would be expected by chance alone. In addition, the overall magnitude of correlation was greater in genetic correlation matrices than in phenotypic correlation matrices in 85 per cent of the comparisons. Several studies which reported correlations within and among distinct suites of traits provided the opportunity to evaluate correlations among functionally or developmentally related characters. It was determined from these studies that traits belonging to the same suite of characters were more highly genetically and phenotypically correlated than traits from different suites.},

abstract = {The four gases, nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) all readily inhibit oxygen consumption by mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase. This inhibition is responsible for much of their toxicity when they are applied externally to the body. However, recently these gases have all been implicated, to greater or lesser extents, in normal cellular signalling events. In this review we analyse the chemistry of this inhibition, comparing and contrasting mechanism and discussing physiological consequences. The inhibition by NO and CO is dependent on oxygen concentration, but that of HCN and H(2)S is not. NO and H(2)S are readily metabolised by oxidative processes within cytochrome oxidase. In these cases the enzyme may act as a physiological detoxifier of these gases. CO oxidation is much slower and unlikely to be as physiologically important. The evidence for normal physiological levels of these gases interacting with cytochrome oxidase is equivocal, in part because there is little robust data about their steady state concentrations. A reasonable case can be made for NO, and perhaps CO and H(2)S, inhibiting cytochrome oxidase in vivo, but endogenous levels of HCN seem unlikely to be high enough.},

abstract = {Fifty years ago, Ehrlich and Raven proposed that insect herbivores have driven much of plant speciation, particularly at tropical latitudes. There have been no explicit tests of their hypotheses. Indeed there were no proposed mechanisms either at the time or since by which herbivores might generate new plant species. Here we outline two main classes of mechanisms, prezygotic and postzygotic, with a number of scenarios in each by which herbivore-driven changes in host plant secondary chemistry might lead to new plant lineage production. The former apply mainly to a sympatric model of speciation while the latter apply to a parapatric or allopatric model. Our review suggests that the steps of each mechanism are known to occur individually in many different systems, but no scenario has been thoroughly investigated in any one system. Nevertheless, studies of Dalechampia and its herbivores and pollinators, and patterns of defense tradeoffs in trees on different soil types in the Peruvian Amazon provide evidence consistent with the original hypotheses of Ehrlich and Raven. For herbivores to drive sympatric speciation, our findings suggest that interactions with both their herbivores and their pollinators should be considered. In contrast, herbivores may drive speciation allopatrically without any influence by pollinators. Finally, there is evidence that these mechanisms are more likely to occur at low latitudes and thus more likely to produce new species in the tropics. The mechanisms we outline provide a predictive framework for further study of the general role that herbivores play in diversification of their host plants.},

abstract = {We present an approach for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, termed as 'lineage-specific QTL mapping', for inferring allelic changes of QTL evolution along with branches in a phylogeny. We describe and analyze the simplest case: by adding a third taxon into the normal procedure of QTL mapping between pairs of taxa, such inferences can be made along lineages to a presumed common ancestor. Although comparisons of QTL maps among species can identify homology of QTLs by apparent co-location, lineage-specific mapping of QTL can classify homology into (1) orthology (shared origin of QTL) versus (2) paralogy (independent origin of QTL within resolution of map distance). In this light, we present a graphical method that identifies six modes of QTL evolution in a three taxon comparison. We then apply our model to map lineage-specific QTLs for inbreeding among three taxa of yellow monkey-flower: Mimulus guttatus and two inbreeders M. platycalyx and M. micranthus, but critically assuming outcrossing was the ancestral state. The two most common modes of homology across traits were orthologous (shared ancestry of mutation for QTL alleles). The outbreeder M. guttatus had the fewest lineage-specific QTL, in accordance with the presumed ancestry of outbreeding. Extensions of lineage-specific QTL mapping to other types of data and crosses, and to inference of ancestral QTL state, are discussed.},

abstract = {Species barriers, expressed as hybrid inviability and sterility, are often due to epistatic inter-actions between divergent loci from two lineages. Theoretical models indicate that the strength, direction, and complexity of these genetic interactions can strongly affect the expression of interspecific reproductive isolation and the rates at which new species evolve. Nonetheless, empirical analyses have not quantified the frequency with which loci are involved in interactions affecting hybrid fitness, and whether these loci predominantly inter-act synergistically or antagonistically, or preferentially involve loci that have strong individual effects on hybrid fitness. We systematically examined the prevalence of interactions between pairs of short chromosomal regions from one species (Solanum habrochaites) co-introgressed into a heterospecific genetic background (Solanum lycopersicum), using lines containing pairwise combinations of 15 chromosomal segments from S. habrochaites in the background of S. lycopersicum (i.e., 95 double introgression lines). We compared the strength of hybrid incompatibility (either pollen sterility or seed sterility) expressed in each double introgression line to the expected additive effect of its two component single intro-gressions. We found that epistasis was common among co-introgressed regions. Interac-tions for hybrid dysfunction were substantially more prevalent in pollen fertility compared to seed fertility phenotypes, and were overwhelmingly antagonistic (i.e., double hybrids were less unfit than expected from additive single introgression effects). This pervasive antago-nism is expected to attenuate the rate at which hybrid infertility accumulates among lineages over time (i.e., giving diminishing returns as more reproductive isolation loci accumulate), as well as decouple of patterns of accumulation of sterility loci and hybrid incompatibility pheno-types. This decoupling effect might explain observed differences between pollen and seed fertility in their fit to theoretical predictions of the accumulation of isolation loci, including the 'snowball' effect.},

abstract = {Flowering plants display spectacular floral diversity and a bewildering array of reproductive adaptations that promote mating, particularly outbreeding. A striking feature of this diversity is that related species often differ in pollination and mating systems, and intraspecific variation in sexual traits is not unusual, especially among herbaceous plants. This variation provides opportunities for evolutionary biologists to link micro-evolutionary processes to the macro-evolutionary patterns that are evident within lineages. Here, I provide some personal reflections on recent progress in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of plant reproductive diversity. I begin with a brief historical sketch of the major developments in this field and then focus on three of the most significant evolutionary transitions in the reproductive biology of flowering plants: the pathway from outcrossing to predominant self-fertilization, the origin of separate sexes (females and males) from hermaphroditism and the shift from animal pollination to wind pollination. For each evolutionary transition, I consider what we have discovered and some of the problems that still remain unsolved. I conclude by discussing how new approaches might influence future research in plant reproductive biology.},

abstract = {1.Understanding the factors affecting species occurrence is a pre-eminent focus of applied ecological research. However, direct information about species occurrence is lacking for many species. Instead, researchers sometimes have to rely on so-called presence-only data (i.e. when no direct information about absences is available), which often results from opportunistic, unstructured sampling. maxent is a widely used software program designed to model and map species distribution using presence-only data. 2.We provide a critical review of maxent as applied to species distribution modelling and discuss how it can lead to inferential errors. A chief concern is that maxent produces a number of poorly defined indices that are not directly related to the actual parameter of interest – the probability of occurrence ($\psi$). This focus on an index was motivated by the belief that it is not possible to estimate $\psi$ from presence-only data; however, we demonstrate that $\psi$ is identifiable using conventional likelihood methods under the assumptions of random sampling and constant probability of species detection. 3.The model is implemented in a convenient r package which we use to apply the model to simulated data and data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. We demonstrate that maxent produces extreme under-predictions when compared to estimates produced by logistic regression which uses the full (presence/absence) data set. We note that maxent predictions are extremely sensitive to specification of the background prevalence, which is not objectively estimated using the maxent method. 4.As with maxent, formal model-based inference requires a random sample of presence locations. Many presence-only data sets, such as those based on museum records and herbarium collections, may not satisfy this assumption. However, when sampling is random, we believe that inference should be based on formal methods that facilitate inference about interpretable ecological quantities instead of vaguely defined indices.},

abstract = {Research indicates that the invasiveness of Centaurea stoebe is attributed to the stronger allelopathic effects on the native North American species than on the related European species, which is one of the unquestionable aspects of the "novel weapons hypothesis (NWH)." Studies originating from controlled to field conditions have shown that C. stoebe utilizes its biochemical potential to exert its invasiveness. The roots of C. stoebe secrete a potent phytotoxin, catechin, which has a detrimental effect on the surrounding plant species. Although, studies on catechin secretion and phytotoxicity represent one of the most well studied systems describing negative plant-plant interactions, it has also sparked controversies lately due to its phytotoxicity dosages and secretion effluxes. Previous reports negate the phytotoxic and pro-oxidant nature of catechin.1-3 In our recent study we have shown that catechin is highly phytotoxic against Arabidopsis thaliana and Festuca idahoensis. We also show that () catechin applied to roots of A. thaliana induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) confirming the pro-oxidant nature of catechin. In addition, activation of signature cell death genes such as acd2 and cad1 post catechin treatment in A. thaliana ascertains the phytotoxic nature of catechin.},

abstract = {The genetic architecture of local adaptation has been of central interest to evolutionary biologists since the modern synthesis. In addition to classic theory on the effect size of adaptive mutations by Fisher, Kimura and Orr, recent theory addresses the genetic architecture of local adaptation in the face of ongoing gene flow. This theory predicts that with substantial gene flow between populations local adaptation should proceed primarily through mutations of large effect or tightly linked clusters of smaller effect loci. In this study, we investigate the genetic architecture of divergence in flowering time, mating system-related traits, and leaf shape between Mimulus laciniatus and a sympatric population of its close relative M. guttatus. These three traits are probably involved in M. laciniatus' adaptation to a dry, exposed granite outcrop environment. Flowering time and mating system differences are also reproductive isolating barriers making them 'magic traits'. Phenotypic hybrids in this population provide evidence of recent gene flow. Using next-generation sequencing, we generate dense SNP markers across the genome and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in flowering time, flower size and leaf shape. We find that interspecific divergence in all three traits is due to few QTL of large effect including a highly pleiotropic QTL on chromosome 8. This QTL region contains the pleiotropic candidate gene TCP4 and is involved in ecologically important phenotypes in other Mimulus species. Our results are consistent with theory, indicating that local adaptation and reproductive isolation with gene flow should be due to few loci with large and pleiotropic effects.},

abstract = {The songs of many birds are unusual in that they serve a role in identifying conspecific mates, yet they are also culturally transmitted. Noting the apparently high rate of diversity in one avian taxon, the songbirds, in which song learning appears ubiquitous, it has often been speculated that cultural transmission may increase the rate of speciation. Here we examine the possibility that song learning affects the rate of allopatric speciation. We construct a population-genetic model of allopatric divergence that explores the evolution of genes that underlie learning preferences (predispositions to learn some songs over others). We compare this with a model in which mating signals are inherited only genetically. Models are constructed for the cases where songs and preferences are affected by the same or different loci, and we analyze them using analytical local stability analysis combined with simulations of drift and directional sexual selection. Under nearly all conditions examined, song divergence occurs more readily in the learning model than in the nonlearning model. This is a result of reduced frequency-dependent selection in the learning models. Cultural evolution causes males with unusual genotypes to tend to learn from the majority of males around them, and thus develop songs compatible with the majority of the females in the population. Unusual genotypes can therefore be masked by learning. Over a wide range of conditions, learning therefore reduces the waiting time for speciation to occur and can be predicted to accelerate the rate of speciation.},

Here we provide evidence for disruptive sexual selection against hybrids between Heliconius cydno and Heliconius melpomene. The two species are sympatric across most of Central and Andean South America, and coexist despite a low level of hybridization. No-choice mating experiments show strong assortative mating between the species. Hybrids mate readily with one another, but both sexes show a reduction in mating success of over 50{\%} with the parental species. Mating preference is associated with a shift in the adult colour pattern, which is involved in predator defence through M{\"{u}}llerian mimicry, but also strongly affects male courtship probability. The hybrids, which lie outside the curve of protection afforded by mimetic resemblance to the parental species, are also largely outside the curves of parental mating preference. Disruptive sexual selection against F(1) hybrids therefore forms an additional post-mating barrier to gene flow, blurring the distinction between pre-mating and post-mating isolation, and helping to maintain the distinctness of these hybridizing species.},

But what is the question to which QTNs are the answer? Although their pursuit is often invoked as a means of addressing the molecular basis of phenotypic evolution or of estimating the roles of evolutionary forces, the QTNs that are accessible to experimentalists, QTNs of relatively large effect, may be uninformative about these issues if large-effect variants are unrepresentative of the alleles that matter. Although 20th century evolutionary biology generally viewed large-effect variants as atypical, the field has recently undergone a quiet realignment toward a view of readily discoverable large-effect alleles as the primary molecular substrates for evolution. I argue that neither theory nor data justify this realignment. Models and experimental findings covering broad swaths of evolutionary phenomena suggest that evolution often acts via large numbers of small-effect polygenes, individually undetectable. Moreover, these small-effect variants are different in kind, at the molecular level, from the large-effect alleles accessible to experimentalists. Although discoverable QTNs address some fundamental evolutionary questions, they are essentially misleading about many others.},

Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development.

abstract = {Museum records have great potential to provide valuable insights into the vulnerability, historic distribution, and conservation of species, especially when coupled with species-distribution models used to predict species' ranges. Yet, the increasing dependence on species-distribution models in identifying conservation priorities calls for a more critical evaluation of model robustness. We used 11 bird species of conservation concern in Brazil's highly fragmented Atlantic Forest and data on environmental conditions in the region to predict species distributions. These predictions were repeated for five different model types for each of the 11 bird species. We then combined these species distributions for each model separately and applied a reserve-selection algorithm to identify priority sites. We compared the potential outcomes from the reserve selection among the models. Although similarity in identification of conservation reserve networks occurred among models, models differed markedly in geographic scope and flexibility of reserve networks. It is essential for planners to evaluate the conservation implications of false-positive and false-negative errors for their specific management scenario before beginning the modeling process. Reserve networks selected by models that minimized false-positive errors provided a better match with priority areas identified by specialists. Thus, we urge caution in the use of models that overestimate species' occurrences because they may misdirect conservation action. Our approach further demonstrates the great potential value of museum records to biodiversity studies and the utility of species-distribution models to conservation decision-making. Our results also demonstrate, however, that these models must be applied critically and cautiously.},

We tested this prediction by suppressing insects in replicated field populations of a native plant, Oenothera biennis, which reduced seed predation, altered interspecific competitive dynamics, and resulted in rapid evolutionary divergence. Comparative genotyping and phenotyping of nearly 12,000 O. biennis individuals revealed that in plots protected from insects, resistance to herbivores declined through time owing to changes in flowering time and lower defensive ellagitannins in fruits, whereas plant competitive ability increased. This independent real-time evolution of plant resistance and competitive ability in the field resulted from the relaxation of direct selective effects of insects on plant defense and through indirect effects due to reduced herbivory on plant competitors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolution of ecological divergence in closely related species is a key component of adaptive radiation. However, in most examples of adaptive radiation the mechanistic basis of ecological divergence remains unclear. A classic example is seen in the young benthic and limnetic stickleback species pairs of British Columbia. In each pair the benthic species feeds on littoral macroinvertebrates whereas the limnetic feeds on pelagic zooplankton. Previous studies indicate that in both short-term feeding trials and long-term enclosure studies, benthics and limnetics exhibit enhanced performance on their own resource but fare more poorly on the other species' resource. We examined the functional basis of ecological divergence in the stickleback species pair from Paxton Lake, BC, using biomechanical models of fish feeding applied to morphological traits. We examined the consequences of morphological differences using high speed video of feeding fish.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Benthic stickleback possess morphological traits that predict high suction generation capacity, including greatly hypertrophied epaxial musculature. In contrast, limnetic stickleback possess traits thought to enhance capture of evasive planktonic prey, including greater jaw protrusion than benthics and greater displacement advantage in both the lower jaw-opening lever system and the opercular four-bar linkage. Kinematic data support the expectations from the morphological analysis that limnetic stickleback exhibit faster strikes and greater jaw protrusion than benthic fish, whereas benthics exert greater suction force on attached prey.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We reveal a previously unknown suite of complex morphological traits that affect rapid ecological divergence in sympatric stickleback. These results indicate that postglacial divergence in stickleback involves many functional systems and shows the value of investigating the functional consequences of phenotypic divergence in adaptive radiation.},

abstract = {Female mate choice has often been proposed to play an important role in cases of rapid speciation, in particular in the explosively evolved haplochromine cichlid species flocks of the Great Lakes of East Africa. Little, if anything, is known in cichlid radiations about the heritability of female mating preferences. Entirely sympatric distribution, large ecological overlap and conspicuous differences in male nuptial coloration, and female preferences for these, make the sister species Pundamilia pundamilia and P. nyererei from Lake Victoria an ideally suited species pair to test assumptions on the genetics of mating preferences made in models of sympatric speciation. Female mate choice is necessary and sufficient to maintain reproductive isolation between these species, and it is perhaps not unlikely therefore, that female mate choice has been important during speciation. A prerequisite for this, which had remained untested in African cichlid fish, is that variation in female mating preferences is heritable. We investigated mating preferences of females of these sister species and their hybrids to test this assumption of most sympatric speciation models, and to further test the assumption of some models of sympatric speciation by sexual selection that female preference is a single-gene trait. We find that the differences in female mating preferences between the sister species are heritable, possibly with quite high heritabilities, and that few but probably more than one genetic loci contribute to this behavioural speciation trait with no apparent dominance. We discuss these results in the light of speciation models and the debate about the explosive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Victoria.},

abstract = {* Plant induced resistance to herbivory affects the spatial distribution of herbivores, as well as their performance. In recent years, theories regarding the benefit to plants of induced resistance have shifted from ideas of optimal resource allocation towards a more eclectic set of theories that consider spatial and temporal plant variability and the spatial distribution of herbivores among plants. However, consensus is lacking on whether induced resistance causes increased herbivore aggregation or increased evenness, as both trends have been experimentally documented.   * We created a spatial individual-based model that can describe many plant–herbivore systems with induced resistance, in order to analyse how different aspects of induced resistance might affect herbivore distribution, and the total damage to a plant population, during a growing season.   * We analyse the specific effects on herbivore aggregation of informed herbivore movement (preferential movement to less-damaged plants) and of information transfer between plants about herbivore attacks, in order to identify mechanisms driving both aggregation and evenness. We also investigate how the resulting herbivore distributions affect the total damage to plants and aggregation of damage.   * Even, random and aggregated herbivore distributions can all occur in our model with induced resistance. Highest levels of aggregation occurred in the models with informed herbivore movement, and the most even distributions occurred when the average number of herbivores per plant was low. With constitutive resistance, only random distributions occur. Damage to plants was spatially correlated, unless plants recover very quickly from damage; herbivore spatial autocorrelation was always weak.   * Our model and results provide a simple explanation for the apparent conflict between experimental results, indicating that both increased aggregation and increased evenness of herbivores can result from induced resistance. We demonstrate that information transfer from plants to herbivores, and from plants to neighbouring plants, can both be major factors in determining non-random herbivore distributions.},

abstract = {Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit heritable genetic variation. Lande proposed that high levels of heritable variation may be maintained by mutation in the face of stabilizing selection. Several analyses have appeared of two distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis of a model with triallelic loci. None of the approximate analyses presented are mathematically rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the domains of validity for alternative approximations, numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its connection to the models. Although the mathematical results and underlying biological requirements of my analyses are quite different from those of Lande, the results do not refute his hypothesis that considerable additive genetic variance may be maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I argue that the validity of this hypothesis can only be determined with additional data and mathematics. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

We are convinced that the sole prospect for a sustainable identification capability lies in the construction of systems that employ DNA sequences as taxon 'barcodes'.

First, we demonstrate that COI profiles, derived from the low-density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species-level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive COI profiles. A model COI profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100{\%} successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens. When fully developed, a COI identification system will provide a reliable, cost-effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification.

abstract = {Urban environments present an opportunity to study the evolution of animal communication in acoustically novel habitats. Several species of birds raise the minimum frequency of vocalizations in urban noise, which is louder at lower frequencies. We recorded 12 species of birds in urban and nonurban environments, and tested whether the extent to which different species raise their minimum frequency is related to the frequency range they use. We found that raising the minimum frequency is common in urban birds and is not restricted to passerine song, but also occurs in other vocalizations of passerines and parrots. There was a strong curvilinear relation between the extent to which urban birds raise the minimum frequency and the typical minimum frequency of the species: species with intermediate minimum frequencies (around 1-1.5 kHz) raised the frequency more than species with either higher or lower minimum frequency. This suggests that high-frequency species, which are less affected by urban noise, do not need to adjust the frequency of vocalizations as much. It also suggests that for species with very low frequencies, in a frequency range where urban noise augments exponentially, increasing frequency may not overcome masking by noise efficiently, and these species may use different adaptations. This indicates that frequency differences between species influence the way in which they respond to the same communication problem (masking by low-frequency noise), and possibly also the subsequent evolution of acoustic signals. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Both chromosomal rearrangements and negative interactions among loci (Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities) have been advanced as the genetic mechanism underlying the sterility of interspecific hybrids. These alternatives invoke very different evolutionary histories during speciation and also predict different patterns of sterility in artificial hybrids. Chromosomal rearrangements require drift, inbreeding, or other special conditions for initial fixation and, because heterozygosity per se generates any problems with gamete formation, F1 hybrids will be most infertile. In contrast, Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities may arise as byproducts of adaptive evolution and often affect the segregating F2 generation most severely. To distinguish the effects of these two mechanisms early in divergence, we investigated the quantitative genetics of hybrid sterility in a line cross between two members of the Mimulus guttatus species complex (M. guttatus and M. nasutus). Hybrids showed partial male and female sterility, and the patterns of infertility were not consistent with the action of chromosomal rearrangements alone. F2 and F1 hybrids exhibited equal decreases in pollen viability ({\textgreater} 40{\%}) relative to the highly fertile parental lines. A large excess of completely pollen-sterile F2 genotypes also pointed to the segregation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility factors affecting male fertility. Female fertility showed a pattern similarly consistent with epistatic interactions: F2 hybrids produced far fewer seeds per flower than F1 hybrids (88.0 +/- 2.8 vs. 162.9 +/- 8.5 SE, respectively) and either parental line, and many F2 genotypes were completely female sterile. Dobzhansky-Muller interactions also resulted in the breakdown of several nonreproductive characters and appear to contribute to correlations between male and female fertility in the F2 generation. These results parallel and contrast with the genetics of postzygotic isolation in model animal systems and are a first step toward understanding the process of speciation in this well-studied group of flowering plants.},

We suggest that instead of being contradictory, differences in speciation rates across different scales can be reconciled by a common model. Under the "ephemeral speciation model", speciation is very common and very rapid but the new species produced almost never persist. Evolutionary studies should therefore focus on not only the formation but also the persistence of new species.},

abstract = {Gene flow between closely related species is not always impeded by hybrid inviability or sterility but may be limited by behavioural or ecological factors. European common redstarts, Phoenicurus phoenicurus, and black redstarts, P. ochruros, are insectivorous passerine bird species which regularly interbreed in the wild and produce viable and fertile progeny. Yet, the isolation barriers, which prevent extensive gene flow between these distinct species, are unknown. I studied prey-handling time and efficiency in both species and the F1-hybrids in captivity. All birds changed prey-handling mode from a single pick to more complex behaviour with increasing prey length and their handling time was a positive function of prey length. Common redstarts tended to handle their prey quicker than black redstarts. Hybrids appeared to be intermediate. However, individual differences were significant, but group membership was not. Handling efficiency decreased with increasing prey length and was determined by individual and family effects. Hybrid females handled their prey as efficient as hybrid males. Small differences in beak morphology could not explain individual differences in prey-handling behaviour. The results of this study suggest that prey-handling in F1-hybrids is not a postzygotic barrier which prevent gene flow between common and black redstarts in the wild.},

Although pollinators commonly act as selective agents on floral traits, determining the extent to which they have influenced angiosperm diversification requires a historical perspective. Here we review recent studies that combine species-level phylogenies with pollinator data and show that pollinator shifts are common, being associated with at least a quarter of documented divergence events. However, shift frequency and directionality vary extensively, owing to variation in intrinsic factors such as floral features and phylogenetic history, as well as extrinsic factors such as interactions with local pollinator assemblages.

abstract = {Despite intensive morphological and molecular studies of Onagraceae, relationships within the family are not fully understood. One drawback of previous analyses is limited sampling within the large tribe Onagreae. In addition, the monophyly of two species-rich genera in Onagreae, Camissonia and Oenothera, has never been adequately tested. To understand relationships within Onagraceae, test the monophyly of these two genera, and ascertain the affinities of the newly discovered genus Megacorax, we conducted parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses with rbcL and ndhF sequence data for 24 taxa representing all 17 Onagraceae genera and two outgroup Lythraceae. Results strongly support a monophyletic Onagraceae, with Ludwigia as the basal lineage and a sister-taxon relationship between Megacorax and Lopezia. Gongylocarpus is supported as sister to Epilobieae plus the rest of Onagreae, although relationships within the latter clade have limited resolution. Thus, we advocate placement of Gongylocarpus in a monogeneric tribe, Gongylocarpeae. Most relationships within Onagreae are weakly resolved, suggesting a rapid diversification of this group in western North America. Neither Camissonia nor Oenothera appears to be monophyletic; however, increased taxon sampling is needed to clarify those relationships. Morphological characters generally agree with the molecular data, providing further support for relationships.},

Using an F2 mapping population derived from an intraspecific cross between a serpentine and a nonserpentine ecotype of Silene vulgaris, the genetic architecture of seven morphological, physiological and life-history traits was explored. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified 23 QTLs, 15 of which were classified as major QTLs. The observed genetic architecture suggests that traits potentially involved in habitat adaptation are controlled by few genes of major effect and have evolved under consistent directional selection. Several linkage groups harboured overlapping QTLs for different traits, which can be due to either pleiotropy or linkage. The potential roles of these factors and of the time available for habitat adaptation and ecological speciation on serpentine are discussed.},

We examined territorial responses of male dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis thurberi, to song playback in association with colonization of an environment very different from that experienced by the ancestral population. A small population of dark-eyed juncos became established on the campus of the University of California at San Diego in the early 1980s. This population experiences a milder climate than the nearby mountain population from which it was probably derived. The San Diego juncos have a breeding season that is more than twice as long and rear about twice as many young per individual. When confronted with song playback, male responses in such traits as the total number of songs and total number of swoops in the San Diego population were about half those recorded in the mountain population. Previous work has shown that the amount of white in the tail of this species (a trait used in aggressive displays) has also decreased in the San Diego population, and lowered territorial response may be one reason favouring the evolution of less white. ?? 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {From an herbivore's first bite, plants release herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) which can attract enemies of herbivores. However, other animals and competing plants can intercept HIPVs for their own use, and it remains unclear whether HIPVs serve as an indirect defense by increasing fitness for the emitting plant. In a 2-year field study, HIPV-emitting N. attenuata plants produced twice as many buds and flowers as HIPV-silenced plants, but only when native Geocoris spp. predators reduced herbivore loads (by 50{\%}) on HIPV-emitters. In concert with HIPVs, plants also employ antidigestive trypsin protease inhibitors (TPIs), but TPI-producing plants were not fitter than TPI-silenced plants. TPIs weakened a specialist herbivore's behavioral evasive responses to simulated Geocoris spp. attack, indicating that TPIs function against specialists by enhancing indirect defense.As the population of the world continues to increase beyond 7 billion, and agricultural pests continue to rapidly evolve resistance to pesticides, it is becoming ever more important to cultivate arable land in a way that is sustainable for both humans and the environment. A better understanding of the different mechanisms used by wild plants to deter herbivores will help to increase crop production without harming the environment.Plants use both direct and indirect methods to fend off herbivores. Direct defense methods include the production of chemicals that are toxic to herbivores or give them indigestion, and the growth of sticky prickles and spines that can injure or kill the herbivore. Indirect defense methods, on the other hand, generally rely on the plant attracting organisms that are either predators or parasites of the herbivore.Plants produce odors known as herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that are thought to offer indirect defense against herbivores by betraying their location to predators and parasites. However, HIPVs also influence other members of the ecological community, sometimes in ways that are detrimental to plants. Moreover, despite 30 years of research, no study has demonstrated that HIPVs increase the fitness of a plant, so it is unclear what they have evolved to do.Now, a 2-year field study by Schuman et al. has shown plants that emit green leaf volatiles (which are a type of HIPV) produce twice as many buds and flowers—a measure of fitness—as plants that have been genetically engineered not to emit green leaf volatiles. This study was conducted with Nicotiana attenuata, which is a wild tobacco plant that is often targeted by Manduca sexta, a type of moth that is also known as the tobacco hornworm. Green leaf volatiles only increased plants' fitness when various species of Geocoris—a bug that preys on Manduca sexta—reduced the number of herbivores by a factor of two. This is the first evidence that HIPVs offer indirect defense against herbivores.Schuman et al. also studied the effects of molecules called protease inhibitors that are thought to function as direct defenses by making it difficult for herbivores to digest plants. They found that the ability to produce protease inhibitors did not increase the fitness of plants under herbivore attack; however, tobacco hornworms that had been fed plants containing protease inhibitors were found to be more sluggish in response to attack, which suggests that protease inhibitors can enhance the indirect defenses of plants. The results suggest that employing both direct and indirect defenses—such as a combination of biological pesticides and genetic engineering to produce both HIPVs and protease inhibitors—is the best approach for defending agricultural plants against pests.},

abstract = {Urbanization changes local environmental conditions and may lead to altered selection regimes for life history traits of organisms thriving in cities. Previous studies have reported changes in breeding phenology and even trends toward increased sedentariness in migratory bird species colonizing urban areas. However, does the change in migratory propensity simply represent a phenotypic adjustment to local urban environment, or is it genetically based and hence the result of local adaptation? To test this, we hand-raised European Blackbirds (Turdus merula) from urban and forest populations, quantified their nocturnal activity and fat deposition covering two complete migratory cycles and examined the consequences of a reduced migratory propensity for the timing of gonadal development (a physiological measure of the seasonal timing of reproduction). Although nocturnal activities differed strikingly between fall and spring seasons, with low activities during the fall and high activities during the spring seasons, our data confirm, even in birds kept from early life under common-garden conditions, a change toward reduced migratoriness in urban blackbirds. The first score of a principal component analysis including amount of nocturnal activity and fat deposition, defined as migratory disposition, was lower in urban than in forest males particularly during their first year, whereas females did not differ. The results suggest that the intrinsic but male-biased difference is genetically determined, although early developmental effects cannot be excluded. Moreover, individuals with low migratory disposition developed their gonads earlier, resulting in longer reproductive seasons. Since urban conditions facilitate earlier breeding, intrinsic shifts to sedentariness thus seem to be adaptive in urban habitats. These results corroborate the idea that urbanization has evolutionary consequences for life history traits such as migratory behavior.},

abstract = {Floral evolution has often been associated with differences in pollina- tion syndromes. Recently, this conceptual structure has been criticized on the grounds that flowers attract a broader spectrum of visitors than one might expect based on their syndromes and that flowers often diverge without excluding one type of pollinator in favorof another. Despite these criticisms, we showthat pollination syndromes provide great utility in understanding the mechanisms of floral diversification. Our conclusions are based on the importance of organizing pollinators into functional groups according to presumed similarities in the selection pressures they exert. Furthermore, functional groups vary widely in their effectiveness as pollinators for particular plant species. Thus, although a plant may be visited by several functional groups, the relative se- lective pressures they exert will likely be very different.We discuss various methods of documenting selection on floral traits. Our review of the literature indicates over- whelming evidence that functional groups exert different selection pressures on floral traits.We also discuss the gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of pollination syndromes. In particular, we need more information about the relative importance of specific traits in pollination shifts, about what selective factors favor shifts between functional groups, about whether selection acts on traits inde- pendently or in combination, and about the role of history in pollination-syndrome evolution.},

abstract = {This study investigates the extent of pollinator sharing and specialization of three co- occurring species of milkweed (Asclepias) in experimental plantings. The potential for competition among plants for pollinators was also assessed from observed levels of pollinator constancy, inter- specific pollination, and seed set in experimental populations. All three species (A. incarnate, A. syriaca, and A. verticillata) were visited by a wide variety of Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. Niche breadth estimates for populations of A. syriaca were compar- atively low (.09-.27); Bombus griseocollis and the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera, were clearly the most common visitors to this species. Niche breadths were greater, implying less specialization, for A. incarnate (xt = .30) and A. v'erticillata (x - .39). Paper wasps (Polistes) and digger wasps (Sphex) were numerous and effective pollinators of A. vwerticillata, but bumblebees comprised the largest proportion (27{\%}) of the pollinators at some sites. Similarly, utilization of pollinators by A. incarnata was highly dependent on the locality of the population studied, with Sphex pennsylvanicus, Apis mellifera, Bombuis griseocollis, and Xylocopa lvirginica constituting the most abundant pollina- tors. Intraspecific comparisons of the similarity of pollinators among populations of A. syriaca gave values that were higher than corresponding values for different species within a locality, implying possible niche differentiation with respect to this species. However, a hypothesis of pollinator par- titioning among species was not accepted for A. incarnatai and A. vterticillata because estimates of niche overlap between these species were as great as those involving populations of either species alone. Both the timing and amount of flowering, as well as the degree of interplanting of A. v erticillata and A. incarnate, affected the abundance and constancy of pollinators on these species in experi- mental plots. Interspecific flights of pollinators and interspecific insertion of pollinia for A. incarnate were much higher in 1978 when flowering of A. verticillata was earlier and more extensive. During that same year, interspecific pollination of A. verticillata was lower. In addition, the abundance of Bombs griseocollis on this species declined rapidly as A. incarnate came into flower, even though peak flowering of A. verticillata had not been reached. Mixed plantings of these species gave higher levels of interspecific pollination and lower seed set than unispecific plantings at the same density. The lack of specialization in pollination of A. incarnata and A. v'erticillata is not surprising since these species typically occupy different habitats and have nectar that is readily accessible. However, the current proliferation of disturbed environments where species occur in close proximity provides the potential for exploitative competition between them when pollinators are a scarce or limiting resource. The presence of pollen from other species may also interfere with intraspecific pollination, reducing seed set. The fitness reduction may be small, however, in view of the perennial habit and abundant seed produced by plants of these species. Key},

Previous studies have provided evidence for functional coadaptation between CYC and ETS complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and for cytoplasmic effects on the fitness of CYC genotype in copepod hybrids. In this study, selection on CYC genotype is shown to continue into advanced generation hybrids (F2-F8) increasing the likelihood that CYC itself is involved in the interaction (and not a linked factor). Relative viabilities varied markedly between copepods raised in two different temperature/light regimes. These results suggest that both intrinsic coadaptation and extrinsic selection will influence the outcome of natural hybridizations between populations. Furthermore, the results indicate that the fitness of particular hybrid genotypes depends on additional non-mtDNA encoded genes that interact with CYC.},

abstract = {Most organisms and populations have to cope with hostile environments, threatening their existence. Their ability to respond phenotypically and genetically to these challenges and to evolve adaptive mechanisms is, therefore, crucial. The contributions to this book aim at understanding, from a evolutionary perspective, the impact of stress on biological systems. Scientists, applying different approaches spanning from the molecular and the protein level to individuals, populations and ecosystems, explore how organisms adapt to extreme environments, how stress changes genetic structure and affects life histories, how organisms cope with thermal stress through acclimation, and how environmental and genetic stress induce fluctuating asymmetry, shape selection pressure and cause extinction of populations. Finally, it discusses the role of stress in evolutionary change, from stress induced mutations and selection to speciation and evolution at the geological time scale. The book contains reviews and novel scientific results on the subject. It will be of interest to both researchers and graduate students and may serve as a text for graduate courses.},

@article{Vallejo-Marin2016,
abstract = {I. II. III. IV. V. References SUMMARY: An unintended consequence of global change is an increase in opportunities for hybridization among previously isolated lineages. Here we illustrate how global change can facilitate the breakdown of reproductive barriers and the formation of hybrids, drawing on the flora of the British Isles for insight. Although global change may ameliorate some of the barriers preventing hybrid establishment, for example by providing new ecological niches for hybrids, it will have limited effects on environment-independent post-zygotic barriers. For example, genic incompatibilities and differences in chromosome numbers and structure within hybrid genomes are unlikely to be affected by global change. We thus speculate that global change will have a larger effect on eroding pre-zygotic barriers (eco-geographical isolation and phenology) than post-zygotic barriers, shifting the relative importance of these two classes of reproductive barriers from what is usually seen in naturally produced hybrids where pre-zygotic barriers are the largest contributors to reproductive isolation. Although the long-term fate of neo-hybrids is still to be determined, the massive impact of global change on the dynamics and distribution of biodiversity generates an unprecedented opportunity to study large numbers of unpredicted, and often replicated, hybridization 'experiments', allowing us to peer into the birth and death of evolutionary lineages.},

Here, we investigate what aspects of diapause development are differentially affected (1) by comparing the propensities of apple vs. hawthorn-infesting host races of R. pomonella to forgo an initially deep diapause and directly develop into adults, and (2) by determining the chronological order that R. pomonella races and sibling species break diapause and eclose when reared under standardized environmental conditions. The results imply that factors affecting initial diapause depth (and/or differential mortality during the prewintering period) and those determining the timing of diapause termination or rates of post-diapause development are both under differential selection and are to some degree genetically uncoupled in flies. The modular nature of diapause life history adaptation in Rhagoletis suggests that phenology may involve multiple genetic changes and represent a stronger ecological barrier separating phytophagous specialists than is generally appreciated.},

This conceptually appealing hypothesis is incredibly broad in evolutionary scope, encompassing diverse patterns and processes operating over timescales ranging from microbial generations to geological eras. However, we have surprisingly little evidence that large-scale associations between coevolution and diversity reflect a causal relationship at smaller timescales, in which coevolutionary selection is directly responsible for the formation of new species. In this synthesis, we critically evaluate evidence for the often-invoked hypothesis that coevolution is an important process promoting biological diversification.

abstract = {Many animal species communicate with their mates through acoustic signals, but this communication seems to become a struggle in urbanized areas because of increasing anthropogenic noise levels. Several bird species have been reported to increase song frequency by which they reduce the masking impact of spectrally overlapping noise. However, it remains unclear whether such behavioral flexibility provides a sufficient solution to noisy urban conditions or whether there are hidden costs. Species may rely on low frequencies to attract and impress females, and the use of high frequencies may, therefore, come at the cost of reduced attractiveness. We studied the potential tradeoff between signal strength and signal detection in a successful urban bird species, the great tit (Parus major). We show that the use of low-frequency songs by males is related to female fertility as well as sexual fidelity. We experimentally show that urban noise conditions impair male-female communication and that signal efficiency depends on song frequency in the presence of noise. Our data reveal a response advantage for high-frequency songs during sexual signaling in noisy conditions, whereas low-frequency songs are likely to be preferred. These data are critical for our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic noise on wild-ranging birds, because they provide evidence for low-frequency songs being linked to reproductive success and to be affected by noise-dependent signal efficiency.},

These questions are crucial to predict adaptation in heterogeneous conditions in a broad sense. Empirical evidence documents various patterns of fitness effects across environments but we still lack a framework to analyse these multivariate data. In this paper, we extend Fisher's geometrical model to multiple environments determining distinct peaks. We derive the fitness distribution, in one environment, among mutants with a given fitness in another and the bivariate distribution of random mutants' fitnesses across two or more environments. The geometry of the phenotype-fitness landscape is naturally interpreted in terms of fitness trade-offs between environments. These results may be used to fit/predict empirical distributions or to predict the pattern of adaptation across heterogeneous conditions. As an example, we derive the genomic rate of substitution and of adaptation in a metapopulation divided into two distinct habitats in a high migration regime and show that they depend critically on the geometry of the phenotype-fitness landscape.

To reduce their impact, plants have evolved a wide range of antiherbivore defenses. Schreber's watershield (Brasenia schreberi J.F. Gmel.; Cabombaceae) is a freshwater, aquatic plant that produces a thick mucilage on the underside of leaves and all underwater organs. The mucilage has been proposed as a mechanism of defense against herbivory, but this hypothesis is untested. We conducted a comparative study to determine whether the quantity of mucilage on the underside of leaves is associated with herbivore damage on the leaves. We found that leaves with the thickest mucilage layer were the least damaged. To determine whether mucilage is directly responsible for defense against herbivores, we conducted a manipulative study where we removed the mucilage from the abaxial surface of leaves. We found that demucilated leaves experienced higher amounts of herbivore damage than leaves with their mucilage left intact. We conclude that the mucilage produced by B. schreberi functions to reduce herbivory on leaves, although its association with underwater herbivores and its specific antiherbivore properties remain unknown.},

An efficacious ITS2 DNA barcode was used to make 100{\%} accurate landrace assignments for 150 blind samples representing 15 landraces. Our research revealed that genomic variation is aligned with a fine-scale classification of landraces using traditional knowledge (TK) of local farmers. The landrace classification was highly correlated with traits (morphological, agricultural, and cultural utility) associated with considerable factors such as yield, drought tolerance, growing season, medicinal properties, and nutrition. This could provide a DNA-based model for conservation of genetic diversity and the associated bicultural diversity (TK) of millet landraces, which has sustained marginal farming communities in harsh environments for many generations.},

Senecio vernalis from Israel and S. vulgaris var. vulgaris reached the different developmental stages in a substantially shorter time than did C.

In both species the increased speed of development was achieved through drastic abbreviation of the rosette stage of development rather than through an acceleration of the entire developmental programme.

Recent work on this model by H. A. Orr has demonstrated that as the number of characters increases, there is a significant reduction in the rate of adaptation. Orr has dubbed this a "cost of complexity." Although there is little evidence as to whether such a cost applies in the natural world, we suggest that the prediction is surprising, at least naively. With this in mind, we examine the robustness of Orr's prediction by modifiying the model in various ways that might reduce or remove the cost. In particular, we explore the suggestion that modular pleiotropy, in which mutations affect only a subset of the traits, could play an important role. We conclude that although modifications of the model can mitigate the cost to a limited extent, Orr's finding is robust.},

We also found that herbivore removal mediated the outcome of competitive interactions and altered patterns of dominance across our field sites.

abstract = {During natural colonization events, songs are expected to change as a result of both selection and drift-like processes. We studied song variation within a small isolated population of dark-eyed juncos, Junco hyemalis, which became established in an unusual environment on the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) campus in the early 1980's, and compared this variation with the native range. At UCSD, the average repertoire size is 4.2 song types/male, which is similar to that in the native range. There is a low level of song-type sharing across the population. Typically a male shares at least one song type with on average 40{\%} of his neighbors, and song-type sharing decreases rapidly with distance. Thus song-type diversity is high, and in this respect appears similar to that in ancestral mountain populations. These results suggest a moderate to large number of males founded and/or subsequently immigrated into the UCSD population, but several selection mechanisms, if coupled with a high cultural mutation rate, may also favor high song-type diversity. When combined with results from a previous study, songs are significantly shorter at UCSD than in the mountain population we studied. It appears that founder effects have not influenced the evolution of songs in this population. More generally, if song-type diversity and other features of song result from various social and natural selection pressures, many of these pressures may have remained similar between the native and the recently established population.},

@article{Strauss1999a,
abstract = {In this paper, we examine how ecological costs of resistance might be manifested through plant relationships with pollinators. If defensive compounds are incorporated into floral structures or if they are sufficiently costly that fewer rewards are offered to pollinators, pollinators may discriminate against more defended plants. Here we consider whether directional selection for increased resistance to herbivores could be constrained by opposing selection through pollinator discrimination against more defended plants. We used artificial selection to create two populations of Brassica rapa plants that had high and low myrosinase concentrations and, consequently, high and low resistance to flea beetle herbivores. We measured changes in floral characters of plants in both damaged and undamaged states from these populations with different resistances to flea beetle attack. We also measured pollinator visitation to plants, including numbers of pollinators and measures of visit quality (numbers of flowers visited and time spent per flower). Damage from herbivores resulted in reduced petal size, as did selection for high resistance to herbivores later in the plant lifetime. In addition, floral display (number of open flowers) was also altered by an interaction between these two effects. Changes in floral traits translated into overall greater use of low-resistance, undamaged plants based on total amount of time pollinators spent foraging on plants. Total numbers of pollinators attracted to plants did not differ among treatments; however, pollinators spent significantly more time per flower on plants from the low-resistance population and tended to visit more flowers on these plants as well. Previous work by other investigators on the same pollinator taxa has shown that longer visit times are associated with greater male and female plant fitness. Because initial numbers of pollinators did not differ between selection regimes, palatability and/or amount of rewards offered by high- and low-resistance populations are likely to be responsible for these patterns. During periods of pollinator limitation, less defended plants may have a selective advantage and pollinator preferences may mediate directional selection imposed by herbivores. In addition, if pollinator preferences limit seed set in highly defended plants, then lower seed set previously attributed to allocation costs of defense may also reflect greater pollinator limitation in these plants relative to less defended plants.},

Addressing this question is a grand challenge that lies at the heart of many current research programmes in ecology and conservation (Sutherland et al., 2006) and will continue to garner our attention for the foreseeable future. Our understand- ing of the future is constrained by our limited understanding of the processes that govern how biodiversity originates, is main- tained and is diminished. Indeed, the future is rife with uncer- tainty but this much is clear: human activities are changing the world's climate, reducing and fragmenting habitats and trans- forming ecological systems globally (Willis {\&} Bhagwat, 2009). There is every expectation that these processes will continue, perhaps at an accelerated pace. For centuries, biogeographers have},

abstract = {Homoploid hybrid speciation--speciation via hybridization without a change in chromosome number--is rarely documented and poorly understood in animals. In particular, the mechanisms by which animal homoploid hybrid species become ecologically and reproductively isolated from their parents are hypothetical and remain largely untested by experiments. For the many host-specific parasites that mate on their host, choosing the right host is the most important ecological and reproductive barrier between these species. One example of a host-specific parasite is the Lonicera fly, a population of tephritid fruit flies that evolved within the last 250 years likely by hybridization between two native Rhagoletis species following a host shift to invasive honeysuckle. We studied the host preference of the Lonicera fly and its putative parent species in laboratory experiments. The Lonicera fly prefers its new host, introduced honeysuckle, over the hosts of both parental species, demonstrating the rapid acquisition of preference for a new host as a means of behavioral isolation from the parent species. The parent taxa discriminate against each other's native hosts, but both accept honeysuckle fruit, leaving the potential for asymmetric gene flow from the parent species. Importantly, this pattern allows us to formulate hypotheses about the initial formation of the Lonicera fly. As mating partners from the two parent taxa are more likely to meet on invasive honeysuckle than on their respective native hosts, independent acceptance of honeysuckle by both parents likely preceded hybridization. We propose that invasive honeysuckle served as a catalyst for the local breakdown of reproductive isolation between the native parent species, a novel consequence of the introduction of an exotic weed. We describe behavioral mechanisms that explain the initial hybridization and subsequent reproductive isolation of the hybrid Lonicera fly. These results provide experimental support for a combination of host shift and hybridization as a model for hybrid speciation in parasitic animals.},

abstract = {Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in chemical defense is thought to play a major role in plant-herbivore interactions. We investigated genetic variation for inducibility of defensive traits in wild radish plants and asked if the evolution of induction is constrained by costs of phenotypic plasticity. In a greenhouse experiment using paternal half-sibling families, we show additive genetic variation for plasticity in glucosinolate concentration. Genetic variation for glucosinolates was not detected in undamaged plants, but was significant following herbivory by a specialist herbivore, Pieris rapae. On average, damaged plants had 55{\%} higher concentrations of glucosinolates compared to controls. In addition, we found significant narrow-sense heritabilities for leaf size, trichome number, flowering phenology, and lifetime fruit production. In a second experiment, we found evidence of genetic variation in induced plant resistance to P. rapae. Although overall there was little evidence for genetic correlations between the defensive and life-history traits we measured, we show that more plastic families had lower fitness than less plastic families in the absence of herbivory (i.e., evidence for genetic costs of plasticity). Thus, there is genetic variation for induction of defense in wild radish, and the evolution of inducibility may be constrained by costs of plasticity.},

City parks are analogous systems as they create geographically isolated green spaces that differ in size, structure, and complexity. Very little, however, is known about whether city parks in single urban centres drive selection and result in the diversification of native species. Here, we provide evidence for the rapid genetic and morphological differentiation of a native lizard (Intellagama lesueurii) at four geographically close yet unconnected parks within one city. Year of establishment of each city park varied from 1855 (oldest) to 2001 (youngest) equating to a generation time range of 32 to three generations. Genetic divergence among city park populations was large despite the small pairwise geographic distances ({\textless} 5km) and found to be two to three times higher for microsatellites and three to 33 times higher for mtDNA relative to non-urban populations. Patterns of morphological differentiation were also found to be most extensive among the four city park populations. In contrast to non-urban populations, city park populations showed significant differentiation in relative body size, relative head and limb morphology and relative forelimb and hindlimb length. Crucially, we show that these patterns of differentiation are unlikely to have been caused by founder events and/or drift alone. Our results suggest that city park ‘archipelagos' could represent theatres for rapid evolution that may, in time, favour adaptive diversification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biological invasions are a major ecological and socio-economic problem in many parts of the world. Despite an explosion of research in recent decades, much remains to be understood about why some species become invasive whereas others do not. Recently, polyploidy (whole genome duplication) has been proposed as an important determinant of invasiveness in plants. Genome duplication has played a major role in plant evolution and can drastically alter a plant's genetic make-up, morphology, physiology and ecology within only one or a few generations. This may allow some polyploids to succeed in strongly fluctuating environments and/or effectively colonize new habitats and, thus, increase their potential to be invasive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSCOPE: We synthesize current knowledge on the importance of polyploidy for the invasion (i.e. spread) of introduced plants. We first aim to elucidate general mechanisms that are involved in the success of polyploid plants and translate this to that of plant invaders. Secondly, we provide an overview of ploidal levels in selected invasive alien plants and explain how ploidy might have contributed to their success.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Polyploidy can be an important factor in species invasion success through a combination of (1) 'pre-adaptation', whereby polyploid lineages are predisposed to conditions in the new range and, therefore, have higher survival rates and fitness in the earliest establishment phase; and (2) the possibility for subsequent adaptation due to a larger genetic diversity that may assist the 'evolution of invasiveness'. Alternatively, polyploidization may play an important role by (3) restoring sexual reproduction following hybridization or, conversely, (4) asexual reproduction in the absence of suitable mates. We, therefore, encourage invasion biologists to incorporate assessments of ploidy in their studies of invasive alien species.},

abstract = {The role of natural selection in the maintenance of genetic variation in wild populations remains a major problem in evolution. The influence of disruptive natural selection on genetic variation is especially interesting because it might lead to the evolution of assortative mating or dominance [1, 2]. In theory, variation can persist at a gene under disruptive natural selection, but the process is little studied and there are few examples [3, 4]. We report a stable polymorphism in the bony armor of threespine stickleback maintained with a deficit of heterozygotes at the major underlying gene, Ectodysplasin (Eda) [5]. The deficit vanishes at the embryo life stage only to re-emerge in adults, indicating that disruptive natural selection, rather than nonrandom mating, is the cause. The mechanism enabling long-term persistence of the polymorphism is unknown, but disruptive selection is predicted to be frequency dependent, favoring homozygous genotypes when they become rare. Further research on the ecological and evolutionary processes affecting individual genes will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the causes of genetic variation in populations. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The evolution of complex organisms is a puzzle for evolutionary theory because beneficial mutations should be less frequent in complex organisms, an effect termed "cost of complexity." However, little is known about how the distribution of mutation fitness effects (f(s)) varies across genomes. The main theoretical framework to address this issue is Fisher's geometric model and related phenotypic landscape models. However, it suffers from several restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we intend to show how several of these limitations may be overcome. We then propose a model of f(s) that extends Fisher's model to account for arbitrary mutational and selective interactions among n traits. We show that these interactions result in f(s) that would be predicted by a much smaller number of independent traits. We test our predictions by comparing empirical f(s) across species of various gene numbers as a surrogate to complexity. This survey reveals, as predicted, that mutations tend to be more deleterious, less variable, and less skewed in higher organisms. However, only limited difference in the shape of f(s) is observed from Escherichia coli to nematodes or fruit flies, a pattern consistent with a model of random phenotypic interactions across many traits. Overall, these results suggest that there may be a cost to phenotypic complexity although much weaker than previously suggested by earlier theoretical works. More generally, the model seems to qualitatively capture and possibly explain the variation of f(s) from lower to higher organisms, which opens a large array of potential applications in evolutionary genetics.},

Hypertrophic lips evolved repeatedly and independently in African and Neotropical cichlid radiations. Cichlids with hypertrophic lips forage predominantly in rocky crevices and it has been hypothesized that mechanical stress caused by friction could result in larger lips through phenotypic plasticity. To test the influence of the environment on the size and development of lips, we conducted a series of breeding and feeding experiments on Midas cichlids. Full-sibs of Amphilophus labiatus (thick-lipped) and Amphilophus citrinellus (thin-lipped) each were split into a control group which was fed food from the water column and a treatment group whose food was fixed to substrates. We found strong evidence for phenotypic plasticity on lip area in the thick-lipped species, but not in the thin-lipped species. Intermediate phenotypic values were observed in hybrids from thick- and thin-lipped species reared under "control" conditions. Thus, both a genetic, but also a phenotypic plastic component is involved in the development of hypertrophic lips in Neotropical cichlids. Moreover, species-specific adaptive phenotypic plasticity was found, suggesting that plasticity is selected for in recent thick-lipped species.},

abstract = {The cyanogenic glycosides belong to the products of secondary metabolism, to the natural products of plants. These compounds are composed of an $\alpha$-hydroxynitrile type aglycone and of a sugar moiety (mostly D-glucose). The distribution of the cyanogenic glycosides (CGs) in the plant kingdom is relatively wide, the number of CG-containing taxa is at least 2500, and a lot of such taxa belong to families Fabaceae, Rosaceae, Linaceae, Compositae and others. Different methods of determination are discussed (including the indirect classical photometrical and the new direct chromatographic ones). The genetic control of cyanogenesis has no unique mechanism, the plants show variation in the amount of the produced HCN. The production of HCN depends on both the biosynthesis of CGs and on the existence (or absence) of its degrading enzymes. The biosynthetic precursors of the CGs are different L-amino acids, these are hydroxylated then the N-hydroxylamino acids are converted to aldoximes, these are turned into nitriles. The last ones are hydroxylated to $\alpha$-hydroxynitriles and then they are glycosilated to CGs. The generation of HCN from CGs is a two step process involving a deglycosilation and a cleavage of the molecule (regulated by $\beta$-glucosidase and $\alpha$-hydroxynitrilase). The tissue level compartmentalisation of CGs and their hydrolysing enzymes prevents large-scale hydrolysis in intact plant tissue. The actual level of CGs is determined by various factors both developmental and ecological ones, which are reviewed too. The last part of the present work demonstrates the biological roles of CGs in plant physiological processes and in plant defence mechanisms as well. The effect of CGs (HCN) on different animals, the symptoms of poisonings are discussed to cows, sheep, donkeys, horses and chicks. Finally, the poisonous effects of cassava (Manihot esculenta) roots are summarised on experimental animals and on the human organism. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Research on endocrine disruption in frog populations, such as shifts in sex ratios and feminization of males, has predominantly focused on agricultural pesticides. Recent evidence suggests that suburban landscapes harbor amphibian populations exhibiting similar levels of endocrine disruption; however the endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) sources are unknown. Here, we show that sex ratios of metamorphosing frogs become increasingly female-dominated along a suburbanization gradient. We further show that suburban ponds are frequently contaminated by the classical estrogen estrone and a variety of EDCs produced by plants (phytoestrogens), and that the diversity of organic EDCs is correlated with the extent of developed land use and cultivated lawn and gardens around a pond. Our work also raises the possibility that trace-element contamination associated with human land use around suburban ponds may be contributing to the estrogenic load within suburban freshwaters and constitutes another source of estrogenic exposure for wildlife. These data suggest novel, unexplored pathways of EDC contamination in human-altered environments. In particular, we propose that vegetation changes associated with suburban neighborhoods (e.g., from forests to lawns and ornamental plants) increase the distribution of phytoestrogens in surface waters. The result of frog sex ratios varying as a function of human land use implicates a role for environmental modulation of sexual differentiation in amphibians, which are assumed to only have genetic sex determination. Overall, we show that endocrine disruption is widespread in suburban frog populations and that the causes are likely diverse.},

The effective number of genetic factors differentiating taxa for each of six characters was estimated from backcross and F-2 segregation variances, using a model that incorporates dominance. The number of factors, averaged over taxa pairs, ranged from 5.3 (for stigma-anther separation) to 12.8 (for pistil length). Dominance was slight to moderate for most characters, with a slight bias for inbreeding characteristics to be dominant over outbreeding traits. F-2 segregation patterns indicate strong genetic correlations among floral size characters but variable correlation of these characters with flowering time and little correlation with stigma-anther separation. Crosses between the two selfing and two outcrossing taxa did not lead to the recovery of extreme transgressive segregants in the F-2. These results suggest that either homologous loci are involved in repeated shifts to selfing or that the likelihood of appearance of novel recombinations is limited by the large number of loci, each with small effect. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of recent models of mating system evolution.},

Specifically, we compared thermal tolerances of ants from inside and outside of the city. Knock-down resistance and chill-coma recovery were used as indicators of heat and cold tolerances, respectively.

Interestingly, greater heat tolerance came at no obvious expense of cold tolerance; hence, our observations only partially support current theory. Our results indicate that thermal tolerances of some organisms can respond to rapid changes in climate.

abstract = {Reproductive isolation between species may often be attained by multiple isolating barriers, but the components are rarely studied in animal taxa. To elucidate the nature of multiple isolating barriers, we quantified the strength of three premating barriers, including ecologically based ones (seasonal, habitat, and sexual), two postmating-prehatching barriers (reduced egg hatchability and conspecific sperm precedence [CSP]), and one posthatching barrier, including four components of F(1) hybrid reduced fitness, between two phytophagous ladybird beetles, Henosepilachna vigintioctomaculata and H. pustulosa. We detected five positive barriers (habitat isolation, sexual isolation, reduced egg hatchability, CSP, and reduced egg hatchability in backcrosses of F(1) hybrids). None of these barriers entirely prevents gene exchange when it acts alone, but jointly they generate nearly complete reproductive isolation even between sympatric populations. Host fidelity contributed most strongly to reproductive isolation by reducing interspecific hybridization through several important types of ecological isolation, including microspatial, habitat, and seasonal isolation. The existence of multiple isolating barriers likely helps keep reproductive isolation stable and robust, by complementing changes in the strength of leaky barriers. This complementarity of multiple isolating barriers yields the concept of robustness of reproductive isolation, which is important when considering the long-term maintenance of species boundaries in coexisting species pairs.},

abstract = {There has been a great deal of recent discussion of the practice of regression analysis (or more generally, linear modelling) in behaviour and ecology. In this paper, I wish to highlight two factors that have been under- considered, collinearity and measurement error in predic- tors, as well as to consider what happens when both exist at the same time. I examine what the consequences are for conventional regression analysis (ordinary least squares, OLS) as well as model averaging methods, typified by information theoretic approaches based around Akaike's information criterion. Collinearity causes variance inflation of estimated slopes in OLS analysis, as is well known. In the presence of collinearity, model averaging reduces this variance for predictors with weak effects, but also can lead to parameter bias. When collinearity is strong or when all predictors have strong effects, model averaging relies heavily on the full model including all predictors and hence the results from this and OLS are essentially the same. I highlight that it is not safe to simply eliminate collinear variables without due consideration of their likely independent effects as this can lead to biases. Measurement error is also considered and I show that when collinearity exists, this can lead to extreme biases when predictors are collinear, have strong effects but differ in their degree of measurement error. I highlight techniques for dealing with and diagnosing these prob- lems. These results reinforce that automated model selection techniques should not be relied on in the analysis of complex multivariable datasets.},

abstract = {Genetic theories of adaptation generally overlook the genes in which beneficial substitutions occur, and the likely variation in their mutational effects. We investigate the consequences of heterogeneous mutational effects among loci on the genetics of adaptation. We use a generalization of Fisher's geometrical model, which assumes multivariate Gaussian stabilizing selection on multiple characters. In our model, mutation has a distinct variance–covariance matrix of phenotypic effects for each locus. Consequently, the distribution of selection coefficients s varies across loci. We assume each locus can only affect a limited number of independent linear combinations of phenotypic traits (restricted pleiotropy), which differ among loci, an effect we term “orientation heterogeneity.” Restricted pleiotropy can sharply reduce the overall proportion of beneficial mutations. Orientation heterogeneity has little impact on the shape of the genomic distribution, but can substantially increase the probability of parallel evolution (the repeated fixation of beneficial mutations at the same gene in independent populations), which is highest with low pleiotropy. We also consider variation in the degree of pleiotropy and in the mean s across loci. The latter impacts the genomic distribution of s, but has a much milder effect on parallel evolution. We discuss these results in the light of evolution experiments.},

This formed part of a test of the hypothesis that the Welsh form of S. cambrensis is derived from introduced S. teneriffae rather than having originated in Wales val allopolyploidy as previously supposed. It was established that the 330 bp insertion was carried by all plants of Welsh S. cambrensis and also S. teneriffae, but was absent from the cpDNA of Edinburgh S. cambrensis and all plants of British S. squalidus and S. vulgaris var. vulgaris surveyed. However, two of 19 individuals tested of S. vulgaris var. hibernicus also possessed the cpDNA insertion, indicating that it is present in British material of S. vulgaris, although at low frequency. The close similarity between S. teneriffae and S. cambrensis, especially the Welsh form of S. cambrensis, was confirmed by the results of a restriction analysis of rDNA, and also morphometric and crossing studies, However, isozyme analysis showed that S. teneriffae is monomorphic for beta EST-3 and ACO-1 phenotypes that are not present in Welsh nd Edinburgh S. cambrensis, nor in S. squalidus and S. vulgaris material surveyed. It is concluded that S. teneriffae and S. cambrensis are two closely related allohexaploid taxa that have very similar, but different origins. It is postulated that whereas S. cambrensis (in Wales and Edinburgh) is the allohexaploid of S. vulgaris and S. squalidus, S. teneriffae is possibly the allohexaploid of S. vulgaris and S. glaucus, the latter being a diploid species closely related to S. squalidus.},

abstract = {Many biologists are asking whether environmentally initiated phenotypic change (i.e., 'phenotypic plasticity') precedes, and even facilitates, evolutionary adaptation. However, this 'plasticity-first' hypothesis remains controversial, primarily because comprehensive tests from natural populations are generally lacking. We briefly describe the plasticity-first hypothesis and present much-needed key criteria to allow tests in diverse, natural systems. Furthermore, we offer a framework for how these criteria can be evaluated and discuss examples where the plasticity-first hypothesis has been investigated in natural populations. Our goal is to provide a means by which the role of plasticity in adaptive evolution can be assessed. Phenotypic plasticity has long been proposed to precede and possibly facilitate adaptive evolution.This 'plasticity-first hypothesis' is controversial because skeptics argue that it lacks compelling evidence from natural populations.A chief difficulty with demonstrating plasticity-first evolution in natural populations is that, once a trait has evolved, its evolution cannot be studied in situ. To get around this difficulty, researchers can study extant lineages that act as ancestral-proxies to the lineage possessing the focal trait.Using such an approach, key criteria of the plasticity-first hypothesis can be evaluated using a relatively simple experimental design.Applying these criteria to various systems, the plasticity-first hypothesis has some empirical support. However, more studies are needed to conclusively determine the role of plasticity in adaptive evolution.},

Here, we suggest that caution must be taken in such comparative studies in the choice of measurement scales (and data transformations) for damage levels and plant performance. We demonstrate with a simple scenario of two plant groups of equal tolerance how the choice of scales can lead one to infer that the first group is more tolerant, the second group is more tolerant, or the two groups are equally tolerant-using the identical dataset. We conclude that to make reliable, logically consistent inferences when comparing tolerances among groups of plants, damage and performance should both be on an additive scale or both on a multiplicative scale.},

abstract = {One of the longest debates in biology has been over the relative importance of different isolating barriers in speciation. However, for most species, there are few data evaluating their relative contributions and we can only speculate on the general roles of pre- and postzygotic isolation. Here, we quantify the absolute and cumulative contribution of 19 potential reproductive barriers between two sympatric damselfly sister species, Ischnura elegans and I. graellsii, including both premating (habitat, temporal, sexual and mechanical isolation) and postmating barriers (prezygotic: sperm insemination success and removal rate, oviposition success, fertility, fecundity; postzygotic: hybrid viability, hybrid sterility and hybrid breakdown). In sympatry, total reproductive isolation between I. elegans females and I. graellsii males was 95.2{\%}, owing mostly to a premating mechanical incompatibility (93.4{\%}), whereas other barriers were of little importance. Isolation between I. graellsii females and I. elegans males was also nearly complete (95.8{\%}), which was caused by the cumulative action of multiple prezygotic (n= 4, 75.4{\%}) and postzygotic postmating barriers (n= 5, 7.4{\%}). Our results suggest that premating barriers are key factors in preventing gene flow between species, and that the relative strengths of premating barriers is highly asymmetrical between the reciprocal crosses.},

Species in this genus are morphologically quite similar, but the songs produced by adult males are acoustically distinct. I examined the nature of song variation found within Laupala paranigra and between Laupala kohalensis and L. paranigra, both endemic to the island of Hawaii. Variation within and among species was most notable in the temporal structure of the song, as quantified by the pulse rate. The variation in pulse rate present in natural populations of L. paranigra bred true through the F1 laboratory generation, suggesting that the intraspecific variation in this species has a genetic basis. Interspecific hybridizations between L. kohalensis and L. paranigra successfully produced F1, F2, and backcross generations. Hybrid F1 males from reciprocal crosses sang with significantly different pulse rates, implicating an X chromosomal contribution to the phenotypic difference between these species. Interspecific patterns of inheritance are most consistent with a type-I genetic architecture. Polygenic inheritance of the interspecific pulse-rate variation was observed, and approximately eight genetic factors were estimated to underlie the difference in pulse rate between L. kohalensis and L. paranigra.},

There is no simple solution because species lists used for conservation planning (e.g. threatened species, species richness estimates, species covered by legislation) are often also used to determine which units should be the focus of conservation actions; this despite the fact that the two processes have such different goals and information needs. Species conservation needs two kinds of taxonomic solution: (i) a set of practical rules to standardize the species units included on lists; and (ii) an approach to the units chosen for conservation recovery planning which recognizes the dynamic nature of natural systems and the differences from the units in listing processes that result. These solutions are well within our grasp but require a new kind of collaboration among conservation biologists, taxonomists and legislators, as well as an increased resource of taxonomists with relevant and high-quality skills.},

abstract = {Polygenic variation can be maintained by a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection. When the alleles responsible for variation are rare, many classes of equilibria may be stable. The rate at which drift causes shifts between equilibria is investigated by integrating the gene frequency distribution W2N II (pq)4N mu-1. This integral can be found exactly, by numerical integration, or can be approximated by assuming that the full distribution of allele frequencies is approximately Gaussian. These methods are checked against simulations. Over a wide range of population sizes, drift will keep the population near an equilibrium which minimizes the genetic variance and the deviation from the selective optimum. Shifts between equilibria in this class occur at an appreciable rate if the product of population size and selection on each locus is small (Ns alpha 2 less than 10). The Gaussian approximation is accurate even when the underlying distribution is strongly skewed. Reproductive isolation evolves as populations shift to new combinations of alleles: however, this process is slow, approaching the neutral rate (approximately mu) in small populations.},

We used QTL mapping in hybrids between the bee-pollinated monkeyflower Mimulus lewisii and the closely related selfer Mimulus parishii to determine the genetic basis of divergence in floral traits and flowering time associated with mating-system evolution, and to characterize hybrid anther sterility. We found a moderately polygenic and highly directional basis for floral size evolution, suggesting adaptation from standing variation or in pursuit of a moving optimum, whereas only a few major loci accounted for substantial flowering-time divergence. Cytonuclear incompatibilities caused hybrid anther sterility, confounding estimation of reproductive organ QTLs. The genetic architecture of floral traits associated with selfing in M. parishii was primarily polygenic, as in other QTL studies of this transition, but in contrast to the previously characterized oligogenic basis of a pollinator shift in close relatives. Hybrid anther sterility appeared parallel at the molecular level to previously characterized incompatibilities, but also raised new questions about cytonuclear co-evolution in plants.},

abstract = {Maladaptive hybridization is hypothesized to be an important force driving the evolution of reproductive isolation between closely related species. Because the magnitude and direction of selection can vary across a life cycle, an accurate understanding of the ubiquity of reinforcement requires fitness to be estimated across the life cycle, but the literature is surprisingly depauperate of such studies. We present fitness estimates of laboratory-raised hybrids between the chorus frogs Pseudacris feriarum and Pseudacris nigrita--two species that have undergone reproductive character displacement where they come into secondary contact. By studying viability, mating success, and fertility across the life cycle, we find strong support for reinforcement as the force driving displacement in this system. Specifically, we find hybrid fitness is reduced by 44{\%}. This reduction results from both sexual selection against hybrid males and natural selection on male fertility, but not viability selection. Sexual selection against hybrid males is four times stronger than natural selection. Hybrid female fitness is not reduced, however, suggesting that Haldane's rule may be operating in this system if males are heterogametic. We also found higher variation in hybrid male fertilization success relative to P. feriarum males, suggesting that the hybrid incompatibility genes are polymorphic within one or both of the parent species.},

abstract = {We consider populations that adapt to a sudden environmental change by fixing alleles found at mutation-selection balance. In particular, we calculate probabilities of fixation for previously deleterious alleles, ignoring the input of new mutations. We find that "Haldane's sieve"--the bias against the establishment of recessive beneficial mutations--does not hold under these conditions. Instead probabilities of fixation are generally independent of dominance. We show that this result is robust to patterns of sex expression for both X-linked and autosomal loci. We further show that adaptive evolution is invariably slower at X-linked than autosomal loci when evolution begins from mutation-selection balance. This result differs from that obtained when adaptation uses new mutations, a finding that may have some bearing on recent attempts to distinguish between hitchhiking and background selection by contrasting the molecular population genetics of X-linked vs. autosomal loci. Last, we suggest a test to determine whether adaptation used new mutations or previously deleterious alleles from the standing genetic variation.},

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) trained on presence-only data are frequently used in ecological research and conservation planning. However, users of SDM software are faced with a variety of options, and it is not always obvious how selecting one option over another will affect model performance. Working with MaxEnt software and with tree fern presence data from New Zealand, we assessed whether (a) choosing to correct for geographical sampling bias and (b) using complex environmental response curves have strong effects on goodness of fit. SDMs were trained on tree fern data, obtained from an online biodiversity data portal, with two sources that differed in size and geographical sampling bias: a small, widely-distributed set of herbarium specimens and a large, spatially clustered set of ecological survey records. We attempted to correct for geographical sampling bias by incorporating sampling bias grids in the SDMs, created from all georeferenced vascular plants in the datasets, and explored model complexity issues by fitting a wide variety of environmental response curves (known as "feature types" in MaxEnt). In each case, goodness of fit was assessed by comparing predicted range maps with tree fern presences and absences using an independent national dataset to validate the SDMs. We found that correcting for geographical sampling bias led to major improvements in goodness of fit, but did not entirely resolve the problem: predictions made with clustered ecological data were inferior to those made with the herbarium dataset, even after sampling bias correction. We also found that the choice of feature type had negligible effects on predictive performance, indicating that simple feature types may be sufficient once sampling bias is accounted for. Our study emphasizes the importance of reducing geographical sampling bias, where possible, in datasets used to train SDMs, and the effectiveness and essentialness of sampling bias correction within MaxEnt.},

abstract = {Disruptive selection is often assumed to be relatively rare, because it is dynamically unstable and hence should be transient. However, frequency-dependent interactions such as intraspecific competition may stabilize fitness minima and make disruptive selection more common. Such selection helps explain the maintenance of genetic variation and may even contribute to sympatric speciation. There is thus great interest in determining when and where disruptive selection is most likely. Here, we show that there is a general trend toward weak disruptive selection on trophic morphology in three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in 14 lakes on Vancouver Island. Selection is inferred from the observation that, within a lake, fish with intermediate gill raker morphology exhibited slower growth than phenotypically extreme individuals. Such selection has previously been shown to arise from intraspecific competition for alternate resources. However, not all environments are equally conducive to disruptive selection, which was strongest in intermediate-sized lakes where both littoral and pelagic prey are roughly balanced. Also, consistent with theory, we find that sexual dimorphism in trophic traits tends to mitigate disruptive selection. These results suggest that it may be possible to anticipate the kinds of environments and populations most likely to experience disruptive selection.},

A 3-year field study of the water relations of street trees in New York City was undertaken with the following objectives: (i) to ascertain whether there was empirical evidence for water deficits; (ii) if water deficits occur, to correlate these events with prevailing weather conditions; (iii) to determine whether tree water relations varied systematically with street exposure; (iv) to compare street microclimate with that of a nearby park; (v) to compare water relations of two common street tree species; (vi) to evaluate the effectiveness of a minimum irrigation programme, 2. Water deficits in trees, as evidenced by midday stomatal closure, occurred but with lower frequency than is commonly expected. Average predicted frequency during the summer was 13{\%} over a 21-year period. When deficits occurred, they were demand driven rather than supply limited. Deficit periods were characterized by maximum air temperatures on the street {\textgreater}41-degrees-C and a maximum atmospheric vapour pressure deficit of 7.5 kPa. Official weather station data collected in a nearby park indicated far milder conditions, with a maximum air temperature and vapour pressure deficit of 32-degrees-C and 2.5 kPa, respectively. Over the midday period, the mixing ratio, a conservative measure of atmospheric water content, was 8.4 g kg-1 lower on Columbus Avenue than in the park, indicating that the street microclimate was far drier. 3. The west side of the street received more solar radiation than the east and was usually slightly hotter than either the east or the park. Yet, trees on the west side of the street were not more water stressed. Though Fraxinus pennsylvanica transpired at higher rates and sustained more negative water potentials than Tilia cordata these differences were variable and could not be separated statistically. Similarly, Fraxinus pennsylvanica showed small but statistically non-significant responses to minimal weekly irrigation while Tilia cordata was unresponsive.},

We examined the role of genetic and maternal effects as determinants of population divergence in survival and three important larval life-history traits (growth rate, age, and size at metamorphosis) using reciprocal crosses between two latitudinally separated populations of the common frog (Rana temporaria Linnaeus). Genetic effects were important in all three traits as indicated by the significant effect of male origin, but there was also evidence for nonadditive genetic contributions on metamorphic size and growth rate. Likewise, maternal effect contributions to population divergence were large, partially environment dependent, and apparently acting primarily through egg size in two of three traits. These results suggest that both genetic and maternal effects are important determinants of geographical variation in amphibian life-histories, and that much of the differentiation resulting from maternal effects is mediated through variation in egg size.

As a result of concerns associated with the applications of pesticides to aquatic systems, fluridone is the only USEPA-approved chemical that provides systemic control of hydrilla. After a decrease in fluridone's efficacy at controlling hydrilla, 200 Florida water bodies were sampled to determine the extent of the problem and the biological basis for the reduced efficacy. Our studies revealed that hydrilla phenotypes with two- to six-fold higher fluridone resistance were present in 20 water bodies. Since fluridone is an inhibitor of the enzyme phytoene desaturase (PDS), the gene for PDS (pds) was cloned from herbicide-susceptible and -resistant hydrilla plants. We report for the first time in higher plants three independent herbicide-resistant hydrilla biotypes arising from the selection of somatic mutations at the arginine 304 codon of pds. The three PDS variants had specific activities similar to the wild-type enzyme but were two to five times less sensitive to fluridone. In vitro activity levels of the enzymes correlated with in vivo resistance of the corresponding biotypes. As hydrilla spread rapidly to lakes across the southern United States in the past, the expansion of resistant biotypes is likely to pose significant environmental challenges in the future.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic architecture of evolutionary change remains a long-standing goal in biology. In vertebrates, skeletal evolution has contributed greatly to adaptation in body form and function in response to changing ecological variables like diet and predation. Here we use genome-wide linkage mapping in threespine stickleback fish to investigate the genetic architecture of evolved changes in many armor and trophic traits. We identify {\textgreater}100 quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling the pattern of serially repeating skeletal elements, including gill rakers, teeth, branchial bones, jaws, median fin spines, and vertebrae. We use this large collection of QTL to address long-standing questions about the anatomical specificity, genetic dominance, and genomic clustering of loci controlling skeletal differences in evolving populations. We find that most QTL (76{\%}) that influence serially repeating skeletal elements have anatomically regional effects. In addition, most QTL (71{\%}) have at least partially additive effects, regardless of whether the QTL controls evolved loss or gain of skeletal elements. Finally, many QTL with high LOD scores cluster on chromosomes 4, 20, and 21. These results identify a modular system that can control highly specific aspects of skeletal form. Because of the general additivity and genomic clustering of major QTL, concerted changes in both protective armor and trophic traits may occur when sticklebacks inherit either marine or freshwater alleles at linked or possible "supergene" regions of the stickleback genome. Further study of these regions will help identify the molecular basis of both modular and coordinated changes in the vertebrate skeleton.},

A C-terminal fragment of the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) has been proposed as universal marker for this purpose among animals. Results: Herein we present experimental evidence that the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene fulfills the requirements for a universal DNA barcoding marker in amphibians. In terms of universality of priming sites and identification of major vertebrate clades the studied 16S fragment is superior to COI. Amplification success was 100{\%} for 16S in a subset of fresh and well-preserved samples of Madagascan frogs, while various combination of COI primers had lower success rates.COI priming sites showed high variability among amphibians both at the level of groups and closely related species, whereas 16S priming sites were highly conserved among vertebrates. Interspecific pairwise 16S divergences in a test group of Madagascan frogs were at a level suitable for assignment of larval stages to species (1–17{\%}), with low degrees of pairwise haplotype divergence within populations (0–1{\%}). Conclusion: We strongly advocate the use of 16S rRNA as standard DNA barcoding marker for vertebrates to complement COI, especially if samples a priori could belong to various phylogenetically distant taxa and false negatives would constitute a major problem.},

abstract = {The role of chromosomal inversions in adaptation and speciation is controversial. Historically, inversions were thought to contribute to these processes either by directly causing hybrid sterility or by facilitating the maintenance of co-adapted gene complexes. Because inversions suppress recombination when heterozygous, a recently proposed local adaptation mechanism predicts that they will spread if they capture alleles at multiple loci involved in divergent adaptation to contrasting environments. Many empirical studies have found inversion polymorphisms linked to putatively adaptive phenotypes or distributed along environmental clines. However, direct involvement of an inversion in local adaptation and consequent ecological reproductive isolation has not to our knowledge been demonstrated in nature. In this study, we discovered that a chromosomal inversion polymorphism is geographically widespread, and we test the extent to which it contributes to adaptation and reproductive isolation under natural field conditions. Replicated crosses between the prezygotically reproductively isolated annual and perennial ecotypes of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus, revealed that alternative chromosomal inversion arrangements are associated with life-history divergence over thousands of kilometers across North America. The inversion polymorphism affected adaptive flowering time divergence and other morphological traits in all replicated crosses between four pairs of annual and perennial populations. To determine if the inversion contributes to adaptation and reproductive isolation in natural populations, we conducted a novel reciprocal transplant experiment involving outbred lines, where alternative arrangements of the inversion were reciprocally introgressed into the genetic backgrounds of each ecotype. Our results demonstrate for the first time in nature the contribution of an inversion to adaptation, an annual/perennial life-history shift, and multiple reproductive isolating barriers. These results are consistent with the local adaptation mechanism being responsible for the distribution of the two inversion arrangements across the geographic range of M. guttatus and that locally adaptive inversion effects contribute directly to reproductive isolation. Such a mechanism may be partially responsible for the observation that closely related species often differ by multiple chromosomal rearrangements.},

abstract = {We conducted phylogenetically informed comparative analyses of 81 taxa of Dalechampia (Euphorbiaceae) vines and shrubs to assess the roles of historical contingency and trait interaction in the evolution of plant-defense and pollinator-attraction systems. We asked whether defenses can originate by exaptation from preexisting pollinator attractants, or vice versa, whether plant defenses show escalation, and if so, whether by enhancing one line of defense or by adding new lines of defense. Two major patterns emerged: (i) correlated evolution of several complementary lines of defense of flowers, seeds, and leaves, and (ii) 5 to 6 losses of the resin reward, followed by redeployment of resin for defense of male flowers in 3 to 4 lineages, apparently in response to herbivore-mediated selection for defense of staminate flowers upon relaxation of pollinator-mediated selection on resin. In all cases, redeployment of resin involved reversion to the inferred ancestral arrangement of flowers and resiniferous bractlets. Triterpene resin has also been deployed for defense of leaves and developing seeds. Other unique defenses against florivores include nocturnal closure of large involucral bracts around receptive flowers and permanent closure around developing fruits (until opening again upon dehiscence). Escalation in one major clade occurred through an early dramatic increase in the number of lines of defense and in the other major clade by more limited increases throughout the group's evolution. We conclude that preaptations played important roles in the evolution of unique defense and attraction systems, and that the evolution of interactions with herbivores can be influenced by adaptations for pollination, and vice versa.},

abstract = {Starch-gel electrophoresis was used to analyze muscle and liver tissue for variation in 13 enzymes representing 31 presumptive loci in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from 13 localities scattered throughout the natural geographic range of the species in North America. Ten loci were polymorphic, but only three, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-1*), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI-1*), and phosphoglucomutase (PGM-2*), exhibited polymorphisms at relatively high frequencies across localities. Western populations were fixed for one allele at ADH-1*, eastern populations were fixed for another allele, and populations from intermediate locations in Lake Ontario and Pennsylvania had both alleles. The distributions of alleles at GPI-1* and PGM-2* were similar to that of ADH-1*, exhibiting strong differences between eastern and western populations, although the delineation was not as clear. Western populations were much less variable than eastern populations, and the distribution of alleles indicated that the two groups were derived from Mississippi and Atlantic glacial refugia. Populations near the physiographic discontinuity between the Mississippi and Atlantic drainages in western New York and Pennsylvania exhibited an admixture of typically western and eastern alleles. Such observations are consistent with the mixed faunal history of the region and limited postglacial dispersal of western and eastern populations across the boundary},

abstract = {Herbivory is viewed as a major driver of plant evolution and the most important energy pathway from plants to higher trophic levels. Therefore, understanding patterns of herbivory on plants remains a key focus in evolution and ecology. The evolutionary impacts of leaf herbivory include altering plant fitness, local adaptation, the evolution of defenses, and the diversification of plants as well as natural enemies. Leaf herbivory also impacts ecological processes such as plant productivity, community composition, and ecosystem nutrient cycling. Understanding the impact of herbivory on these ecological and evolutionary processes requires species-specific, as opposed to community-level, measures of herbivory. In addition, species-specific data enables the use of modern comparative methods to account for phylogenetic nonindependence. Although hundreds of studies have measured natural rates of leaf consumption, we are unaware of any accessible compilation of these data. We created such a data set to provide the raw data needed to test general hypotheses relating to plant–herbivore interactions and to test the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on herbivory rates across large spatial scales. A large repository will make this endeavor more efficient and robust. In total, we compiled 2641 population level measures for either annual or daily rates of leaf herbivory across 1145 species of vascular plants collected from 189 studies. All damage measures represent natural occurrences of herbivory that span numerous angiosperm, gymnosperm, and fern species. To enable researchers to explore the causes of variation in herbivory and how these might interact, we added information about the study sites including: geolocation, climate classification, habitat descriptions (e.g., seashore, grassland, forest, agricultural fields), and plant trait information concerning growth form and duration (e.g., annual vs. perennial). We also included extensive details of the methodology used to measure leaf damage, including seasons and months of sampling, age of leaves, and the method used to estimate percentage area missing. We anticipate that these data will make it possible to test important hypotheses in the plant–herbivore literature, including the plant apparency hypothesis, the latitudinal-herbivory defense hypothesis, the resource availability hypothesis, and the macroevolutionary escalation of defense hypothesis.},

abstract = {We review and discuss the importance of correlational selection (selection for optimal character combinations) in natural populations. If two or more traits subject to multivariate selection are heritable, correlational selection builds favourable genetic correlations through the formation of linkage disequilibrium at underlying loci governing the traits. However, linkage disequilibria built up by correlational selection are expected to decay rapidly (ie, within a few generations), unless correlational selection is strong and chronic. We argue that frequency-dependent biotic interactions that have 'Red Queen dynamics' (eg, host-parasite interactions, predator-prey relationships or intraspecific arms races) often fuel chronic correlational selection, which is strong enough to maintain adaptive genetic correlations of the kind we describe. We illustrate these processes and phenomena using empirical examples from various plant and animal systems, including our own recent work on the evolutionary dynamics of a heritable throat colour polymorphism in the side-blotched lizard Uta stansburiana. In particular, male and female colour morphs of side-blotched lizards cycle on five- and two-generation (year) timescales under the force of strong frequency-dependent selection. Each morph refines the other morph in a Red Queen dynamic. Strong correlational selection gradients among life history, immunological and morphological traits shape the genetic correlations of the side-blotched lizard polymorphism. We discuss the broader evolutionary consequences of the buildup of co-adapted trait complexes within species, such as the implications for speciation processes.},

abstract = {Directional evolutionary trends have long garnered interest because they suggest that evolution can be predictable. However, the identification of the trends themselves and the underlying processes that may produce them have often been controversial. In 1862, in explaining the exceptionally long nectar spur of Angraecum sesquipedale, Darwin proposed that a coevolutionary 'race' had driven the directional increase in length of a plant's spur and its pollinator's tongue. Thus he predicted the existence of an exceptionally long-tongued moth. Though the discovery of Xanthopan morgani ssp. praedicta in 1903 with a tongue length of 22 cm validated Darwin's prediction, his 'race' model for the evolution of long-spurred flowers remains contentious. Spurs may also evolve to exceptional lengths by way of pollinator shifts as plants adapt to a series of unrelated pollinators, each with a greater tongue length. Here, using a species-level phylogeny of the columbine genus, Aquilegia, we show a significant evolutionary trend for increasing spur length during directional shifts to pollinators with longer tongues. In addition, we find evidence for 'punctuated' change in spur length during speciation events, suggesting that Aquilegia nectar spurs rapidly evolve to fit adaptive peaks predefined by pollinator morphology. These findings show that evolution may proceed in predictable pathways without reversals and that change may be concentrated during speciation.},

abstract = {Coevolutionary diversification is cited as a major mechanism driving the evolution of diversity, particularly in plants and insects. However, tests of coevolutionary diversification have focused on elucidating macroevolutionary patterns rather than the processes giving rise to such patterns. Hence, there is weak evidence that coevolution promotes diversification. This is in part due to a lack of understanding about the mechanisms by which coevolution can cause speciation and the difficulty of integrating results across micro- and macroevolutionary scales. In this review, we highlight potential mechanisms of coevolutionary diversification, outline approaches to examine this process across temporal scales, and propose a set of minimal requirements for demonstrating coevolutionary diversification. Our aim is to stimulate research that tests more rigorously for coevolutionary diversification. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Urban areas are expanding rapidly, but a few native species have successfully colonized them. The processes underlying such colonization events are poorly understood. Using the blackbird Turdus merula, a former forest specialist that is now one of the most common urban birds in its range, we provide the first assessment of two contrasting urban colonization models. First, that urbanization occurred independently. Second, that following initial urbanization, urban-adapted individuals colonized other urban areas in a leapfrog manner. Previous analyses of spatial patterns in the timing of blackbird urbanization, and experimental introductions of urban and rural blackbirds to uncolonized cities, suggest that the leapfrog model is likely to apply. We found that, across the western Palaearctic, urban blackbird populations contain less genetic diversity than rural ones, urban populations are more strongly differentiated from each other than from rural populations and assignment tests support a rural source population for most urban individuals. In combination, these results provide much stronger support for the independent urbanization model than the leapfrog one. If the former model predominates, colonization of multiple urban centres will be particularly difficult when urbanization requires genetic adaptations, having implications for urban species diversity.},

abstract = {Several authors have proposed that speciation frequently occurs when a population becomes fixed for one or more chromosomal rearrangements that reduce fitness when they are heterozygous. This hypothesis has little theoretical support because mutations that cause a large reduction in fitness can be fixed through drift only in small, inbred populations. Moreover, the effects of chromosomal rearrangements on fitness are unpredictable and vary significantly between plants and animals. I argue that rearrangements reduce gene flow more by suppressing recombination and extending the effects of linked isolation genes than by reducing fitness. This unorthodox perspective has significant implications for speciation models and for the outcomes of contact between neospecies and their progenitor(s).},

abstract = {Are rates of evolution and speciation fastest where diversity is greatest - the tropics? A commonly accepted theory links the latitudinal diversity gradient to a speciation pump model whereby the tropics produce species at a faster rate than extra-tropical regions. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Botero et al. () test the speciation pump model using subspecies richness patterns for more than 9000 species of birds and mammals as a proxy for incipient speciation opportunity. Rather than using latitudinal centroids, the authors investigate the role of various environmental correlates of latitude as drivers of subspecies richness. Their key finding points to environmental harshness as a positive predictor of subspecies richness. The authors link high subspecies richness in environmental harsh areas to increased opportunities for geographic range fragmentation and/or faster rates of trait evolution as drivers of incipient speciation. Because environmental harshness generally increases with latitude, these results suggest that opportunity for incipient speciation is lowest where species richness is highest. The authors interpret this finding as incompatible with the view of the tropics as a cradle of diversity. Their results are consistent with a growing body of evidence that reproductive isolation and speciation occur fastest at high latitudes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Here, we investigate laboratory hybrids between a pair of sympatric Lake Victoria cichlid fish species that appear to have recently evolved from a hybrid popu-lation between similar predecessor species. The species demonstrate strong assortative mating in the laboratory, associated with divergent male breed-ing coloration (red dorsum versus blue). We show in a common garden experiment, using DNA-based paternity testing, that the strong female mate preferences among males of the two species are fully recovered in a large fraction of their F2 hybrid generation. Individual hybrid females often demonstrated consistent preferences in multiple mate choice trials (more than or equal to five) across a year or more. This result suggests that female mate preference is influenced by relatively few major genes or genomic regions. These preferences were not changed by experience of a successful spawning event with a male of the non-preferred species in a no-choice single-male trial. We found no evidence for imprinting in the F2 hybrids, although the F1 hybrid females may have been imprinted on their mothers. We discuss this nearly Mendelian inheritance of consistent innate mate preferences in the context of speciation theory.},

The degree to which two parapatric insect species in the genus Phymata are reproductively isolated was evaluated and several mechanisms that could contribute to the maintenance of species boundaries were assessed. 3. Behavioural assays showed no indication of species-assortative mating, nor any fecundity costs associated with heterospecific mating. Thus, there was no evidence of prezygotic mechanisms of reproductive isolation between the two species. 4. In laboratory crosses, it was found that the two species were indeed capable of producing viable F1 hybrids. Morphologically, these hybrids were phenotypically intermediate to the two parental species, and similar to the phenotypes seen in natural populations thought to occur in a hybrid zone. F1 hybrids did not show reduced viability, although there was some suggestion of ` hybrid breakdown', evident from the lower viability observed for progeny of ` natural hybrids'. 5. Collectively, we show that despite genetically based morphological differences between species, P. americana and pennsylvanica can, and probably do hybridise. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms that maintain the distinct phenotypes and geographical ranges of these species, despite the considerable potential for introgression.},

abstract = {The production of extreme or 'transgressive' phenotypes in segregating hybrid populations has been speculated to contribute to niche divergence of hybrid lineages. Here, we assess the frequency of transgressive segregation in hybrid populations, describe its genetic basis and discuss the factors that best predict its occurrence. From a survey of 171 studies that report phenotypic variation in segregating hybrid populations, we show that transgression is the rule rather than the exception. In fact, 155 of the 171 studies (91{\%}) report at least one transgressive trait, and 44{\%} of 1229 traits examined were transgressive. Transgression occurred most frequently in intraspecific crosses involving inbred, domesticated plant populations, and least frequently in interspecific crosses between outbred, wild animal species. Quantitative genetic studies of plant hybrids consistently point to the action of complementary genes as the primary cause of transgression, although overdominance and epistasis also contribute. Complementary genes appear to be common for most traits, with the possible exception of those with a history of disruptive selection. These results lend credence to the view that hybridization may provide the raw material for rapid adaptation and provide a simple explanation for niche divergence and phenotypic novelty often associated with hybrid lineages.},

abstract = {Abstract  Studies of flowering and leafing phenology have dramatically increased during the last few decades because changes in plant phenology can be indicative of possible effects of climate change at multiple scales. This article reviews the available literature focusing on the effects of urbanization on flowering phenology. The literature of flowering phenology in urban environments suggests that spring-blooming plants in a variety of ecosystems in North America, Europe, and China tend to bloom earlier in the city than in the surrounding un-urbanized habitat. Moreover, ephemerals, early spring bloomers, and insect-pollinated plants in these environments tend to be more sensitive than perennials, mid- or late-spring bloomers, and wind-pollinated plants. Researchers attribute advanced flowering in urban environments to the Heat Island Effect. The potential ecological consequences of changes in flowering phenology in urbanized areas are not well understood or explicitly studied. However, studies in global biology have suggested that climate change may result in a series of important ecological consequences as well as human-related problems such as earlier and extended allergy seasons. More field-based studies are needed to elucidate this issue.},

These differences include frequency shifts, amplitude shifts, altered song speed, and selective meme use. If particular memes sung by urban populations are adapted to the urban soundscape, "urban-typical" calls, memes, or repertoires should be consistently used in multiple urban populations of the same species, regardless of geographic location. We tested whether songs or contact calls of silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) might be subject to such convergent cultural evolution by comparing syllable repertoires of geographically dispersed urban and rural population pairs throughout southeastern Australia. Despite frequency and tempo differences between urban and rural calls, call repertoires were similar between habitat types. However, certain song syllables were used more frequently by birds from urban than rural populations. Partial redundancy analysis revealed that both geographic location and habitat characteristics were important predictors of syllable repertoire composition. These findings suggest convergent cultural evolution: urban populations modify both song and call syllables from their local repertoire in response to noise.},

We have developed a genome-wide linkage map for the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), an extensively studied teleost fish that has undergone rapid divergence and speciation since the melting of glaciers 15,000 years ago. Here we use this map to analyse the genetic basis of recently evolved changes in skeletal armour and feeding morphologies seen in the benthic and limnetic stickleback species from Priest Lake, British Columbia. Substantial alterations in spine length, armour plate number, and gill raker number are controlled by genetic factors that map to independent chromosome regions. Further study of these regions will help to define the number and type of genetic changes that underlie morphological diversification during vertebrate evolution.},

abstract = {Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are vectors of important diseases affecting wild and domestic animals. During the last decade they have played a major role in the epidemiology of the largest bluetongue epizootic ever recorded in Europe, the disease is transmitted between hosts almost exclusively by bites of Culicoides midges and affects both domestic and wild ruminants however severe disease usually occurs in certain breeds of sheep and some species of deer. An accurate vector identification is of major importance in arthropod borne diseases surveillance, as great differences in vectorial capacity are found even between close species. Unfortunately, specialized taxonomic knowledge of Culicoides identification is rarely available in routine surveillance, mainly based on wing morphology. Recently, some European species of Culicoides belonging to the subgenus Avaritia Fox, 1955 and Culicoides Latreille, 1809 have been described as new bluetongue virus vectors. In the present study, by using a fragment of the barcode region (COI gene) we report the presence of up to 11 species within the subgenus Culicoides in Catalonia (NE Spain), a region recently affected by a bluetongue epizootic. The molecular analysis revealed new non-described cryptic species which were grouped in three complexes of morphologically similar species, two in the Pulicaris complex resembling Culicoides pulicaris, two in the Fagineus complex resembling Culicoides fagineus and three in the Newsteadi complex resembling Culicoides newsteadi. The phylogenetic relationships among them showed that cryptic species detected in both Pulicaris and Fagineus complexes were closely related, whereas those in the Newsteadi complex were more distant. Accurate analysis of all species using morphological and molecular approaches resulted in the detection of diagnostic metric traits for cryptic species and the design of several new species-specific single and multiplex PCR assays to identify unambiguously all the species, most of them still lacking a specific molecular diagnosis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies of Pacific three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have uncovered several genomic regions controlling variability in different morphological traits, but QTL studies of Atlantic sticklebacks are lacking. We mapped QTL for 40 morphological traits, including body size, body shape, and body armor, in a F2 full-sib cross between northern European marine and freshwater three-spined sticklebacks. A total of 52 significant QTL were identified at the 5{\%} genome-wide level. One major QTL explaining 74.4{\%} of the total variance in lateral plate number was detected on LG4, whereas several major QTL for centroid size (a proxy for body size), and the lengths of two dorsal spines, pelvic spine, and pelvic girdle were mapped on LG21 with the explained variance ranging from 27.9{\%} to 57.6{\%}. Major QTL for landmark coordinates defining body shape variation also were identified on LG21, with each explaining ≥15{\%} of variance in body shape. Multiple QTL for different traits mapped on LG21 overlapped each other, implying pleiotropy and/or tight linkage. Thus, apart from providing confirmatory data to support conclusions born out of earlier QTL studies of Pacific sticklebacks, this study also describes several novel QTL of both major and smaller effect for ecologically important traits. The finding that many major QTL mapped on LG21 suggests that this linkage group might be a hotspot for genetic determinants of ecologically important morphological traits in three-spined sticklebacks.},

abstract = {A standard approach to model how selection shapes phenotypic traits is the analysis of capture-recapture data relating trait variation to survival. Divergent selection, however, has never been analyzed by the capture-recapture approach. Most reported examples of differences between urban and nonurban animals reflect behavioral plasticity rather than divergent selection. The aim of this paper was to use a capture-recapture approach to test the hypothesis that divergent selection can also drive local adaptation in urban habitats. We focused on the size of the black breast stripe (i.e., tie width) of the great tit (Parus major), a sexual ornament used in mate choice. Urban great tits display smaller tie sizes than forest birds. Because tie size is mostly genetically determined, it could potentially respond to selection. We analyzed capture/recapture data of male great tits in Barcelona city (N = 171) and in a nearby (7 km) forest (N = 324) from 1992 to 2008 using MARK. When modelling recapture rate, we found it to be strongly influenced by tie width, so that both for urban and forest habitats, birds with smaller ties were more trap-shy and more cautious than their larger tied counterparts. When modelling survival, we found that survival prospects in forest great tits increased the larger their tie width (i.e., directional positive selection), but the reverse was found for urban birds, with individuals displaying smaller ties showing higher survival (i.e., directional negative selection). As melanin-based tie size seems to be related to personality, and both are heritable, results may be explained by cautious personalities being favored in urban environments. More importantly, our results show that divergent selection can be an important mechanism in local adaptation to urban habitats and that capture-recapture is a powerful tool to test it. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Nevertheless, it is often unclear what fitness actually is, and its meaning often depends on the context. Here we argue that fitness should not be a basal ingredient in verbal or mathematical descriptions of evolution. Instead, we propose that evolutionary birth-death processes, in which individuals give birth and die at ever-changing rates, should be the basis of evolutionary theory, because such processes capture the fundamental events that generate evolutionary dynamics. In evolutionary birth-death processes, fitness is at best a derived quantity, and owing to the potential complexity of such processes, there is no guarantee that there is a simple scalar, such as fitness, that would describe long-term evolutionary outcomes. We discuss how evolutionary birth-death processes can provide useful perspectives on a number of central issues in evolution.},

abstract = {Degradation of acoustic signals during transmission presents a challenging selection pressure for animals dependent on vocal communication. Sound transmission properties differ among habitats and may drive the evolution of vocal signals in different directions. Urban habitat is expanding worldwide and an increasing number of species, including many birds, must now communicate around buildings and over concrete. Urban habitats are evolutionarily new, although to some extent they may acoustically resemble rocky habitat such as cliffs and canyons. Neither urban nor these natural habitats have been studied in any detail for the selection pressure they may exert on animal communication. Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) commonly inhabit montane pine forests across North America, but for about 25 years an isolated population has been successfully breeding in an urban environment in southern California. We investigated potentially divergent selection pressures on junco songs, using sound transmission experiments with artificial sound stimuli, in natural forest habitat and in this urban habitat. Transmission properties differed significantly, resulting in tails of reflected sound with gradually declining amplitude in the forest and in multiple discrete echoes in the urban environment. We expected environmental selection in urban habitat to favor shorter songs with higher frequencies and slower trill rates. Despite the presence of relatively short urban songs, there was no significant shortening overall. There were also no differences in trill rates, but we did find a significantly higher minimum frequency in the urban junco population compared to three of four forest populations. Although the pattern of song divergence was not consistent and it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this single urban population, our transmission results suggest that echoes could be important in shaping urban birdsong},

abstract = {Genetic architecture of adaptation is traditionally studied in the context of local adaptation, viz. spatially varying conditions experienced by the species. However, anthropogenic changes in the natural environment pose a new context to this issue, that is, adaptation to an environment that is new for the species. In this study, we used crossbreeding to analyze genetic architecture of adaptation to conditions not currently experienced by the species but with high probability of encounter in the near future due to global climate change. We performed targeted interpopulation crossing using genotypes from two core and two peripheral Triticum dicoccoides populations and raised the parents and three generations of hybrids in a greenhouse under simulated desert conditions to analyze the genetic architecture of adaptation to these conditions and an effect of gene flow from plants having different origin. The hybrid (F1) fitness did not differ from that of the parents in crosses where both plants originated from the species core, but in crosses involving one parent from the species core and another one from the species periphery the fitness of F1 was consistently higher than that of the periphery-originated parent. Plant fitness in the next two generations (F2 and F3) did not differ from the F1, suggesting that effects of epistatic interactions between recombining and segregating alleles of genes contributing to fitness were minor or absent. The observed low importance of epistatic gene interactions in allopolyploid T. dicoccoides and low probability of hybrid breakdown appear to be the result of permanent fixation of heterozygosity and lack of intergenomic recombination in this species. At the same time, predominant but not complete selfing combined with an advantage of bivalent pairing of homologous chromosomes appears to maintain high genetic variability in T. dicoccoides, greatly enhancing its adaptive ability.},

abstract = {The indirect effects of hosts on interactions between parasites and other species are not well understood, and it may be difficult to predict the outcome of host species effects on parasite performance due to the complexity of potential direct and indirect effects. For example, parasitic plants obtain defensive compounds as well as nutrients from their hosts, and thus many attributes of parasitic plants are dependent on the quality of their host species. Here I measure the effect of a lupine host species (Lupinus argenteus) compared to other host species on herbivory, pollination, and female plant fitness in the hemiparasite Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) using a series of field experiments. Association with lupine was determined in the field by assaying Indian paintbrush leaves for lupine alkaloids. I found that Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines experienced reduced herbivory from plume moth larvae, agromyzid fly larvae, and deer, relative to Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing other host species. However, there was no correlation between alkaloid content of inflorescences and plume moth performance. Host species did not affect pollinator preference for Indian paintbrush in the field. Indian paintbrush para- sitizing lupines produced twice as many seeds overall as Indian paintbrush parasitizing other host species. Correlations suggest that this benefit arises both from reduced herbivory and increased nitrogenous resources. The reduction of herbivory in Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines indicates that host species can affect performance of hemiparasites via indirect pathways, and that the larger community of herbivores could alter the impact of a host on its plant parasites.},

abstract = {Speciation is a multifaceted process that involves numerous aspects of the biological sciences and occurs for multiple reasons. Ecology plays a major role, including both abiotic and biotic factors. Whether populations experience similar or divergent ecological environments, they often adapt to local conditions through divergence in biomechanical traits. We investigate the role of biomechanics in speciation using fish predator–prey interactions, a primary driver of fitness for both predators and prey. We highlight specific groups of fishes, or specific species, that have been particularly valuable for understanding these dynamic interactions and offer the best opportunities for future studies that link genetic architecture to biomechanics and reproductive isolation (RI). In addition to emphasizing the key biomechanical techniques that will be instrumental, we also propose that the movement towards linking biomechanics and speciation will include (i) establishing the genetic basis of biomechanical traits, (ii) testing whether similar and divergent selection lead to biomechanical divergence, and (iii) testing whether/how biomechanical traits affect RI. Future investigations that examine speciation through the lens of biomechanics will propel our understanding of this key process.},

abstract = {Canonical variate analysis of plants raised in a uniform environment was used to study the pattern of geographical variation in leaf shape of Crepis tectorum (Asteraceae). The diversity in leaf shape was much greater among populations confined to areas with exposed bedrock in the Baltic region than among weed populations scattered throughout Europe and Canada. A Ward's clustering linked outcrop populations from the archipelago of SW. Finland and the islands of Oland (Sweden) and Saaremaa (Estonia) due to the deeply lobed leaves characterizing these populations, while outcrop populations along the coast of E. Sweden were grouped due to their weakly lobed, narrow and dentate leaves. Most of the weed populations were grouped together but there was no tendency for the variation in this group to be related to habitat or geographical location. A mosaic of variation reflected in sharp (random) differentiation among local populations was superimposed on the large-scale ecogeographical pattern. - Crossing data indicated that most of the variation in degree of leaf dissection is governed by one major gene with deeply lobed leaves dominant over weakly lobed leaves. I suggest that the simple pattern of inheritance may have favoured rapid evolutionary changes in leaf shape, particularly in the Baltic area which emerged relatively late from the sea. Genetic correlations may have constrained the pattern of variation at higher taxonomic levels, since some of the trait associations detected in a segregating F2 generation were also found at the among-population level.},

Moreover, higher temperatures, elevated CO2, and increased inorganic nitrogen deposition along with altered moisture regimes of urban as compared to rural areas creates a compelling analog for studying adaptations of plants to climate change. We grew plants under common conditions in a greenhouse to determine whether populations of Crepis sancta (Asteraceae) differed in phenological, morphological, and physiological traits. We also used a field experiment to test for natural selection on these traits in urban Montpellier, France. Urban plants flowered and senesced later than rural plants, and natural selection favored later phenology in the urban habitat. Natural selection also favored larger plants with more leaves, and increased photosynthesis and leaf nitrogen concentration. Ours is the first study to document selection on plant functional traits in an urban habitat and, as such, advances our understanding of urban plant ecology and possible adaptations to climate change.},

abstract = {Populations that have repeatedly colonized novel environments are useful for studying the role of ecology in adaptive divergence – particularly if some individuals persist in the ancestral habitat. Such “contemporary ancestors” can be used to demonstrate the effects of selection by comparing phenotypic and genetic divergence between the derived population and their extant ancestors. However, evolution and demography in these “contemporary ancestors” can complicate inferences about the source (standing genetic variation, de novo mutation) and pace of adaptive divergence. Marine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have colonized freshwater environments along the Pacific coast of North America, but have also persisted in the marine environment. To what extent are marine stickleback good proxies of the ancestral condition? We sequenced {\textgreater} 5800 variant loci in over 250 marine stickleback from eight locations extending from Alaska to California, and phenotyped them for platedness and body shape. Pairwise FST varied from 0.02 to 0.18. Stickleback were divided into five genetic clusters, with a single cluster comprising stickleback from Washington to Alaska. Plate number, Eda, body shape, and candidate loci showed evidence of being under selection in the marine environment. Comparisons to a freshwater population demonstrated that candidate loci for freshwater adaptation varied depending on the choice of marine populations. Marine stickleback are structured into phenotypically and genetically distinct populations that have been evolving as freshwater stickleback evolved. This variation complicates their usefulness as proxies of the ancestors of freshwater populations. Lessons from stickleback may be applied to other “contemporary ancestor”-derived population studies.},

abstract = {Induction of plant volatiles by leaf-chewing caterpillars is well documented. However, there is much less information about volatile induction by insects with different feeding habits. We studied the induction of plant volatiles by a piercing-sucking insect, the western tarnished plant bug Lygus hesperus Knight. Adults of both genders and nymphs of Lygus induced the local emission of a blend of volatiles from both cotton and maize. Feeding by Lygus also induced the systemic emission of volatiles that was similar but less complex than the blend emitted at the site of feeding. Infestation by mated, mature adult females ({\textgreater}4 days old), but not by nymphs or mature males, caused detectable emission of alpha-pinene, myrcene. and (E)-beta-caryophyllene, compounds that are stored in the glands of cotton tissue. This indicated that damage to glands in the petiole and leaf by the female ovipositor, rather than feeding, contributed significantly to the emission of these volatiles. Girdling the plant stem to disrupt phloem transport markedly decreased the movement of 14C-labeled photosynthetic products to the apex of the plant, and this treatment also markedly reduced the amount of systemically induced volatiles caused by Lygus feeding. Lygus salivary gland extracts were capable of inducing emission of the same volatile blend as measured for plants infested by feeding insects or treated with volicitin. an elicitor isolated from caterpillar regurgitant. The results indicate that L. hesperus is capable of inducing the emission of plant volatiles and that induction is caused by an elicitor that is contained in the insect salivary gland.},

abstract = {Ecological adaptation is the driving force during divergence-with-gene-flow and generates reproductive isolation early in speciation. Although gene flow opposes divergence, local adaptation can be facilitated by factors that prevent the breakup of favorable allelic combinations. We investigated how selection, genetic architecture, and geography have contributed to the maintenance of floral trait divergence and pollinator isolation between parapatric ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. Combining greenhouse, field, and genomic studies, we show that sharp clines in floral traits are maintained by spatially-varying selection. Although adaptation breaks down where the ecotypes co-occur, leading to the formation of a hybrid zone, the largely non-overlapping distributions of the ecotypes shield them from immigrant genes, facilitating divergence across most of the range. In contrast to the sharp genetic discontinuities observed across most hybrid zones, we observed a gradual cline in genome-wide divergence and a pattern of isolation-by-distance across the landscape. Thus, contrary to a long period of allopatry followed by recent re-contact, our data suggest that floral trait divergence in M. aurantiacus may have evolved with locally-restricted, but ongoing gene flow Therefore, our study reveals how the geographic distribution of an organism can contribute to the evolution of premating isolation in the early stages of divergence-with-gene-flow.

abstract = {It has been stated that living plants, especially the flowering plants, furnish the food materials for fully half of the living species of insects. Every part of the plant may be eaten, but green leaves no doubt constitute the bulk of vege- table food material. Since leaves are the principal food of insects, and in most cases the only food, it is obvious that they must contain all the food materials which an insect requires. Yet we find that most insects that eat leaves are more or less selective in their choice of food plant. Insects may feed on only one spe- cies or on a few closely related plant species (monophagy), on a larger group usually confined within a certain plant family (oligophagy), or on a still wider group of plants (polyphagy), but they never feed on all plants. Is host selection in this group of insects governed by the nutritional superiority of the particular plant or region of the plant that serves as a food, or rather by the presence or absence of attractants and repellents in plants which are otherwise of more or less uniform food value?},

Phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphological and chloroplast DNA restriction site characters suggest that shifts from passerine to hummingbird pollination have occurred a minimum of four times in the genus. In hummingbird-pollinated species the inflorescences are held upright, the flowers are arranged radially along the axis, and the narrow standard petal is conduplicately folded to form a pseudotube. In most of the passerine-pollinated species, the inflorescences are held horizontally, the flowers are secund, and the standard petal is open so that the nectar and androecium are easily visible and accessible. Nectar amino acid concentrations and sucrose to hexose ratios are closely associated with pollination mode. Despite the general resemblance in flower and inflorescence morphology among species with the same pollination type, homology assessment reveals that petal morphology and size, and calyx and pollen morphology differ. Morphological characters, even if comprising modifications associated with adaptive pollination systems, therefore provide useful phylogenetic information.},

We show that this has occurred at least once in populations of the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum growing in the Park Grass Experiment where flowering time has shifted at the boundaries between plots. As a consequence, gene flow via pollen has been severely limited and adjacent populations that had a common origin at the start of the experiment in 1856 have now diverged at neutral marker loci.},

One underlying reason for this lies in the confusion that often exists between species discovery and specimen identification, and this is reflected in the way that hypotheses are generated and tested. Although these aims can be associated, they are quite distinct and require different methodological approaches, but their conflation has led to the frequently inappropriate use of commonly used analytical methods such as neighbour-joining trees, bootstrap resampling and fixed distance thresholds. Furthermore, the misidentification of voucher specimens can also have serious implications for end users of reference libraries such as the Barcode of Life Data Systems, and in this regard we advocate increased diligence in the a priori identification of specimens to be used for this purpose. This commentary provides an assessment of seven deficiencies that we identify as common in the DNA barcoding literature, and outline some potential improvements for its adaptation and adoption towards more reliable and accurate outcomes.},

abstract = {Hybridization between genetically divergent populations is an important evolutionary process, with an outcome that is difficult to predict. We used controlled crosses and freely mating hybrid swarms, followed for up to 30 generations, to examine the morphological and fitness consequences of interpopulation hybridization in the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Patterns of fitness in two generations of controlled crosses were partly predictive of long-term trajectories in hybrid swarms. For one pair of populations, controlled crosses revealed neutral or beneficial effects of hybridization after the F1 generation, and hybrid swarm fitness almost always equalled or exceeded that of the midparent. For a second pair, controlled crosses showed F2 hybrid breakdown, but increased fitness in backcrosses, and hybrid swarm fitness deviated both above and below that of the parentals. Nevertheless, individual swarm replicates exhibited different fitness trajectories over time that were not related in a simple manner to their hybrid genetic composition, and fixation of fitter hybrid phenotypes was not observed. Hybridization did not increase overall morphological variation, and underlying genetic changes may have been masked by phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, one type of hybrid swarm exhibited a repeatable pattern of transgressively large eggsacs, indicating a positive effect of hybridization on individual fecundity. Additionally, both parental and hybrid swarms exhibited common phenotypic trends over time, indicating common selective pressures in the laboratory environment. Our results suggest that, in a system where much work has focused on F2 hybrid breakdown, the long-term fitness consequences of interpopulation hybridization are surprisingly benign.},

abstract = {Floral phenotypes may be as much the result of selection for avoidance of some animal visitors as selection for improving the interaction with better pollinators. When specializing on hummingbird-pollination, Penstemon flowers may have evolved to improve the morphological fit between bird and flower, or to exclude less-efficient bees, or both. We hypothesized how such selection might work on four floral characters that affect the mechanics of pollen transfer: anther/stigma exsertion, presence of a lower corolla lip, width of the corolla tube, and angle of flower inclination. We surgically modified bee-pollinated P. strictus flowers changing one trait at a time to make them resemble hummingbird-pollinated P. barbatus flowers, and measured pollen transfer by bumblebees and hummingbirds. Results suggest that, apart from 'pro-bird' adaptations, specific 'anti-bee' adaptations have been important in shaping hummingbird-flowers. Moreover, some trait changes may have been selected for only if changing in concert with other traits.},

abstract = {Special conditions are required for genetic differentiation to arise at a local geographical scale in the face of gene flow. The Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, is the most widely distributed and abundant rodent in sub-Saharan Africa. A notorious agricultural pest and a natural host for many zoonotic diseases, it can live in close proximity to humans and appears to compete with other rodents for the synanthropic niche. We surveyed its population genetic structure across a 180-km transect in central Tanzania along which the landscape varied between agricultural land in a rural setting and natural woody vegetation, rivers, roads and a city (Morogoro). We sampled M. natalensis across 10 localities and genotyped 15 microsatellite loci from 515 individuals. Hierarchical STRUCTURE analyses show a K-invariant pattern distinguishing Morogoro suburbs (located in the centre of the transect) from nine surrounding rural localities. Landscape connectivity analyses in Circuitscape and comparison of rainfall patterns suggest that neither geographical isolation nor natural breeding asynchrony could explain the genetic differentiation of the urban population. Using the isolation-with-migration model implemented in IMa2, we inferred that a split between suburban and rural populations would have occurred recently ({\textless}150 years ago) with higher urban effective population density consistent with an urban source to rural sink of effective migration. The observed genetic differentiation of urban multimammate mice is striking given the uninterrupted distribution of the animal throughout the landscape and the high estimates of effective migration (2N(e)M = 3.0 and 29.7), suggesting a strong selection gradient across the urban boundary.},

abstract = {Model averaging, specifically information theoretic approaches based on Akaike's information criterion (IT-AIC approaches), has had a major influence on statistical practices in the field of ecology and evolution. However, a neglected issue is that in common with most other model fitting approaches, IT-AIC methods are sensitive to the presence of missing observations. The commonest way of handling missing data is the complete-case analysis (the complete deletion from the dataset of cases containing any missing values). It is well-known that this results in reduced estimation precision (or reduced statistical power), biased parameter estimates; however, the implications for model selection have not been explored. Here we employ an example from behavioural ecology to illustrate how missing data can affect the conclusions drawn from model selection or based on hypothesis testing. We show how missing observations can be recovered to give accurate estimates for IT-related indices (e. g. AIC and Akaike weight) as well as parameters (and their standard errors) by utilizing 'multiple imputation'. We use this paper to illustrate key concepts from missing data theory and as a basis for discussing available methods for handling missing data. The example is intended to serve as a practically oriented case study for behavioural ecologists deciding on how to handle missing data in their own datasets and also as a first attempt to consider the problems of conducting model selection and averaging in the presence of missing observations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Investigations of the physiological and morphological changes that occur in plants in response to herbivore damage have identified several potential mechanisms of tolerance. However, it is unlikely that all physiological changes that occur following damage are tolerance mechanisms. Few studies have made direct comparisons between the expression of tolerance and the relative expression of putative mechanisms. I briefly review empirical evidence for some of the better-studied potential mechanisms, including increased photosynthetic activity, compensatory growth, utilization of stored reserves, and phenological delays. For each of these mechanisms I discuss reasons why the relationship between tolerance and these characters may be more complicated than it first appears. I conclude by discussing several empirical approaches, including herbivore manipulations, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, and selection experiments, that will further our understanding of tolerance mechanisms.},

Recurrent adaptive evolution drove the rapid functional divergence of Nup96 in both the D. melanogaster and the D. simulans lineages. Functional divergence of Nup96 between these 2 species is unexpected as Nup96 encodes part of the Nup107 subcomplex, an architectural component of nuclear pore complexes, the macromolecular channels in nuclear envelopes that mediate nucleocytoplasmic traffic in all eukaryotes. Here we study the evolutionary histories of 5 of Nup96's protein interactors--3 stable Nup107 subcomplex proteins (Nup75, Nup107, and Nup133) and 2 mobile nucleoporins (Nup98 and Nup153)--and show that all 5 have experienced recurrent adaptive evolution. These results are consistent with selection-driven coevolution among molecular interactors within species causing the incidental evolution of incompatible interactions seen in hybrids between species. We suggest that genetic conflict-driven processes may have contributed to the rapid molecular evolution of Nup107 subcomplex genes.},

In the present study, we  investigate the effects of ecological and genetic factors on  interspecific divergence in wing morphology, in relation to the pattern  of wing venation and phenotypic plasticity in D. gouveai and D.  antonietae, by means of the comparative analysis of isofemale lines  reared in the two cactus hosts. The species differed significantly in  wing size and shape, although specific differences were mainly  localized in a particular portion of the wing. We detected significant  variation in form among lines, which was not independent of the  breeding cactus, suggesting the presence of genetic variation for  phenotypic plasticity and wing shape variation in both species.

abstract = {The effect of the cyanogenic glucosides linamarin and lotaustralin and their hydrolyzing enzyme linamarase was studied in a B2 generation segregating for the genes Ac and Li. Plants containing the glucosides are protected against grazing by snails both in the seedling stage and as adult plants. In seedlings, however, there is a direct effect on survival, whereas in adult plants the leaf area of plants containing linamarin/lotaustralin is less reduced under intense grazing. Linamarase has no effect on grazing by snails, possibly as a result of the presence of $\beta$-glucosidase activity in the gut of these animals. The genes Ac and Li, or genes tightly linked to them, have other effects as well: plants possessing one dominant Ac allele produce fewer flowers than homozygous ac plants. I compared this difference in flower production to the metabolic cost of producing the cyanogenic glucosides. The energy content of the difference in flower head production far exceeded the metabolic cost of cyanoglucoside production in Acac plants. It is possible that the cost of maintaining a certain level of cyanoglucosides is much more important for the plant than the initial cost of biosynthesis. The importance of the effects of Ac and Li in the maintenance of cyanogenic polymorphism in white clover is discussed.},

These changes can in turn affect the geographic distribution of species, the behaviour of animals and the phenology of plants. The grey-headed flying-fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) is a large, nomadic bat from eastern Australia that roosts in large colonies known as camps. Historically a warm temperate to tropical species, P. poliocephalus recently established a year-round camp in the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne. Using a bioclimatic analysis, we demonstrated that on the basis of long-term data, Melbourne does not fall within the climatic range of other P. poliocephalus camp sites in Australia. Melbourne is drier than other summer camps, and cooler and drier than other winter camps. The city also receives less radiation, in winter and annually, than the other summer and winter camps of P. poliocephalus. However, we found that temperatures in central Melbourne have been increasing since the 1950s, leading to warmer conditions and a reduction in the number of frosts. In addition, artificial watering of parks and gardens in the city may contribute the equivalent of 590 mm (95{\%} CI: 450-720 mm) of extra rainfall per year. It appears that human activities have increased temperatures and effective precipitation in central Melbourne, creating a more suitable climate for camps of the grey-headed flying-fox. As demonstrated by this example, anthropogenic climate change is likely to complicate further the task of conserving biological diversity in urban environments. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the process of speciation requires the quantification of barriers to reproductive isolation, dissection of the genetic mechanisms that contribute to those barriers and determination of the forces driving the evolution of those barriers. Through a comprehensive analysis involving 19 pairs of plant taxa, we assessed the strength and patterns of asymmetry of multiple prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolating barriers. We then reviewed contemporary knowledge of the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and the relative role of chromosomal and genic factors in intrinsic postzygotic isolation. On average, we found that prezygotic isolation is approximately twice as strong as postzygotic isolation, and that postmating barriers are approximately three times more asymmetrical in their action than premating barriers. Barriers involve a variable number of loci, and chromosomal rearrangements may have a limited direct role in reproductive isolation in plants. Future research should aim to understand the relationship between particular genetic loci and the magnitude of their effect on reproductive isolation in nature, the geographical scale at which plant speciation occurs, and the role of different evolutionary forces in the speciation process.},

Based on five plastid loci (rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, psbK-psbI, atpF-atpH) and a nuclear locus [internal transcribed spacer (ITS)], we calculated genetic distances and DNA barcoding gaps individually and in combination and constructed phylogenetic trees to test their ability to distinguish the species of the genus. A total of 228 samples representing 63 putative species in Ficus (Moraceae) of China were included in this study. The results demonstrated that ITS has the most variable sites, greater intra- and inter-specific divergences, the highest species discrimination rate (72{\%}) and higher primer universality among the single loci. It is followed by psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA with moderate variation and considerably lower species discrimination rates (about 19{\%}), whereas matK, rbcL and atpF-atpH could not effectively separate the species. Among the possible combinations of loci, ITS + trnH-psbA performed best but only marginally improved species resolution over ITS alone (75{\%} vs. 72{\%}). Therefore, we recommend using ITS as a single DNA barcoding locus in Ficus.},

abstract = {A holey adaptive landscape is an adaptive landscape where relatively infrequent well-fit combinations of genes form a contiguous set that expands throughout the genotype space. I formulate and study a series of simple models describing the dynamics of speciation on holey adaptive landscapes driven by mutation and random genetic drift. Unlike most previous models that concentrate only on some stages of speciation, the models studied here describe the complete process of speciation from initiation until completion. The evolutionary factors included are selection (reproductive isolation), random genetic drift, mutation, recombination, and migration. In these models, pre- and postmating reproductive isolation is a consequence of cumulative genetic change. I study possibilities for speciation according to allopatric, parapatric, peripatric, and vicariance scenarios. The results presented here, together with earlier numerical simulations, strongly suggest that rapid speciation, including simultaneous emergence of several new species, is a plausible outcome of the evolutionary dynamics of subdivided populations. Rapid speciation is most likely for populations that are subdivided into a large number of small subpopulations. Speciation is possible even when subpopulations exchange several individuals per generation. Selection for local adaptation is not necessary for rapid speciation. I briefly discuss implications of the dynamics on holey adaptive landscapes for the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution and for the theory of evolution of genetic canalization.},

We examined physiological responses of Ipomopsis species and hybrids, including reciprocal F(1)s and F(2)s, to variation in soil moisture and nitrogen. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: To examine responses to moisture, we subjected plants to a dry-down experiment. Nitrogen was manipulated in three independent experiments, one in the field and two in common environments. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Plants with I. tenuituba cytoplasmic background had lower optimal soil moisture for photosynthesis, appearing better adapted to dry conditions, than plants with I. aggregata cytoplasm. This result supported a prediction from prior studies. The species and hybrids did not differ greatly in physiological responses to nitrogen. An increase in soil nitrogen increased leaf nitrogen, carbon assimilation, integrated water-use efficiency, and growth, but the increases in growth were not mediated primarily by an increase in photosynthesis. In neither the field, nor in common-garden studies, did physiological responses to soil nitrogen differ detectably across plant types, although only I. aggregata and hybrids increased seed production in the field. •$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate differences in photosynthetic responses between reciprocal hybrids and suggest that water use is more important than nitrogen in explaining the relative photosynthetic performance of these hybrids compared to their parents.},

abstract = {I examined sexual selection in the iguanid lizard Uta palmeri by measuring phenotypic selection in a cohort of males. Relative fitness was estimated by copulation rate from one breeding season, and I analyzed selection on five morphological traits (snout-vent length, mass, jaw length, head width, and head depth) and on male territory quality. Only territory quality and head depth were identified as direct targets of selection in a linear selection gradient analysis. Head depth was suggested to also be subject to quadratic selection. All traits exhibited significant directional selection differentials, suggesting indirect selection also was present because of the correlation of these traits with direct targets of selection. I used these results to generate hypotheses about the mechanisms of selection. For traits not identified as direct targets of selection (snout-vent length, mass, head width, jaw length), I could accept the null hypothesis of no female preference for the analyzed male traits; if these morphological traits were preferred by females in mate choice, they would have been identified as direct targets of selection. Exploring possible functional relationships within the cohort, I found that all five morphological traits contributed to explaining variation in territorial status. And in staged aggressive interactions between males that were similar in snout-vent length and mass, winning was associated only with greater head depth and not with head width or jaw length. Several possible interpretations of these results are presented. This study suggests that differential mating success arising from variation in territory quality gives rise to indirect selection on morphology. The possible mechanisms giving rise to the proposed direct selection on head depth require further study.},

Results are highly congruent with previous analyses and provide higher bootstrap support for nearly all relationships than in previously published analyses. Important changes to the results of previous work are a well-supported position of Petrosaviaceae as sister to all monocots above Acorales and Alismatales and much higher support for the commelinid clade. For the first time, the spine of the monocot tree has some bootstrap support, although support for paraphyly of liliids is still only low to moderate (79-82{\%}). Dioscoreales and Pandanales are sister taxa (moderately supported, 87-92{\%}), and Asparagales are weakly supported (79{\%}) as sister to the commelinids. Analysis of just the four plastid genes reveals that addition of data from the other two genomes contributes to generally better support for most clades, particularly along the spine. A new collection reveals that previous material of Petermannia was misidentified, and now Petermanniaceae should no longer be considered a synonym of Colchicaceae. Arachnitis (Corsiaceae) falls into Liliales, but its exact position is not well supported. Sciaphila (Triuridaceae) falls with Pandanales. Trithuria (Hydatellaceae) falls in Poales near Eriocaulaceae, Mayacaceae, and Xyridaceae, but until a complete set of genes are produced for this taxon, its placement will remain problematic. Within the commelinid clade, Dasypogonaceae are sister to Poales and Arecales sister to the rest of the commelinids, but these relationships are only weakly supported.},

abstract = {The globally increasing light pollution is a well-recognized threat to ecosystems, with negative effects on human, animal and plant wellbeing. The most well-known and widely documented consequence of light pollution is the generally fatal attraction of nocturnal insects to artificial light sources. However, the evolutionary consequences are unknown. Herewe report that moth populations from urban areas with high, globally relevant levels of light pollution over several decades show a significantly reduced flight-to-light behaviour compared with populations of the same species from pristine dark-sky habitats. Using a common garden setting, we reared moths from 10 different populations from early-instar larvae and experimentally compared their flight-to-light behaviour under standardized conditions. Moths from urban populations had a significant reduction in the flight-to-light behaviour compared with pristine populations. The reduced attraction to light sources of ‘city moths' may directly increase these individuals' survival and reproduction. We anticipate that it comes with a reduced mobility, which negatively affects foraging as well as colonization ability. As nocturnal insects are of eminent significance as pollinators and the primary food source of many vertebrates, an evolutionary change of the flight-to-light behaviour thereby potentially cascades across species interaction networks.},

abstract = {Detailed ecological, morphological and molecular analyses were performed in mixed populations of diploid and autotetraploid Dactylorhiza maculata s.l. in Scandinavia. Comparisons were made with pure populations of either diploid ssp. fuchsii or tetraploid ssp. maculata . It was shown that mixed populations are the result of secondary contact between ssp. fuchsii and ssp. maculata . No patterns of recent and local autopolyploidization were found. Morphology and nuclear DNA markers (internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA) showed that diploids and tetraploids from mixed populations have similar levels of differentiation to diploids and tetraploids from pure populations. Vegetation analyses, as well as analyses of environmental variables, revealed that diploid and tetraploid individuals in mixed populations are ecologically well differentiated on a microhabitat level. Diploids and tetraploids in pure populations have wider ecological amplitudes than they do in mixed populations. Triploid hybrids grew in intermediate microhabitats between diploids and tetraploids in the mixed populations. Plastid DNA markers indicated that both diploids and tetraploids may act as the maternal parent. Based on morphology and nuclear markers triploids are more similar to tetraploids than to diploids. There were indications of introgressive gene flow between ploidy levels. Plastid markers indicated that gene flow from diploid to tetraploid level is most common, but nuclear markers suggested that gene flow in opposite direction also may occur. Similar patterns of differentiation and gene flow appeared in localities that represented contrasting biogeographic regions. Disturbance and topography may explain why hybridization was slightly more common and the differentiation patterns somewhat less clear in the Scandinavian mountains than in the coastal lowland.},

abstract = {Parallel adaptation is common and may often occur from shared genetic variation, but the genomic consequences of this process remain poorly understood. We first use individual-based simulations to demonstrate that comparisons between populations adapted in parallel to similar environments from shared variation reveal a characteristic genomic signature around a selected locus: a low-divergence valley centred at the locus and flanked by twin peaks of high divergence. This signature is initiated by the hitchhiking of haplotype tracts differing between derived populations in the broader neighbourhood of the selected locus (driving the high-divergence twin peaks) and shared haplotype tracts in the tight neighbourhood of the locus (driving the low-divergence valley). This initial hitchhiking signature is reinforced over time because the selected locus acts as a barrier to gene flow from the source to the derived populations, thus promoting divergence by drift in its close neighbourhood. We next empirically confirm the peak-valley-peak signature by combining targeted and RAD sequence data at three candidate adaptation genes in multiple marine (source) and freshwater (derived) populations of threespine stickleback. Finally, we use a genome-wide screen for the peak-valley-peak signature to discover additional genome regions involved in parallel marine-freshwater divergence. Our findings offer a new explanation for heterogeneous genomic divergence and thus challenge the standard view that peaks in population divergence harbour divergently selected loci and that low-divergence regions result from balancing selection or localized introgression. We anticipate that genome scans for peak-valley-peak divergence signatures will promote the discovery of adaptation genes in other organisms.},

Evolutionary changes in breeding systems occur between closely related species, and some changes occur more often than others. Understanding why such changes occur requires combined genetical and ecological approaches. I review the ideas of some of the most important theoretical models, showing how these are based on individual selection using genetic principles to ask whether alleles affecting plants' outcrossing rates or sex morphs will spread in populations. After discussing how the conclusions are affected by some of the many relevant ecological factors, I relate these theoretical ideas to empirical data from some of the many recent breeding system studies in plant populations.},

While much progress has been made in understanding the genes controlling pigmentation in model systems, many questions remain about the genetic basis of pigment traits observed in nature. Lake Malawi cichlid fishes are known for their diversity of male pigmentation patterns, which have been shaped by sexual selection. To begin the process of identifying the genes underlying this diversity, we quantified the number of pigment cells on the body and fins of two species of the genus Metriaclima and their hybrids. We then used the CastleWright equation to estimate that differences in individual pigmentation traits between these species are controlled by one to four genes each. Different pigmentation traits are highly correlated in the F2, suggesting shared developmental pathways and genetic pleiotropy. Melanophore and xanthophore traits fall on opposite ends of the first principal component axis of the F2 phenotypes, suggesting a tradeoff during the development of these two pigment cell types. J.

abstract = {Whole genome duplications have occurred recurrently throughout the evolutionary history of eukaryotes. The resulting genetic and phenotypic changes can influence physiological and ecological responses to the environment; however, the impact of genome copy number on evolvability has rarely been examined experimentally. Here, we evaluate the effect of genome duplication on the ability to respond to selection for early flowering time in lines drawn from naturally occurring diploid and autotetraploid populations of the plant Chamerion angustifolium (fireweed). We contrast this with the result of four generations of selection on synthesized neoautotetraploids, whose genic variability is similar to diploids but genome copy number is similar to autotetraploids. In addition, we examine correlated responses to selection in all three groups. Diploid and both extant tetraploid and neoautotetraploid lines responded to selection with significant reductions in time to flowering. Evolvability, measured as realized heritability, was significantly lower in extant tetraploids ({\^{}}b(T) =  0.31) than diploids ({\^{}}b(T) =  0.40). Neotetraploids exhibited the highest evolutionary response ({\^{}}b(T)  =  0.55). The rapid shift in flowering time in neotetraploids was associated with an increase in phenotypic variability across generations, but not with change in genome size or phenotypic correlations among traits. Our results suggest that whole genome duplications, without hybridization, may initially alter evolutionary rate, and that the dynamic nature of neoautopolyploids may contribute to the prevalence of polyploidy throughout eukaryotes.},

@article{Gadau1999,
abstract = {According to theory, F(2) hybrid breakdown (lethality or sterility) is due to incompatibilities between interacting genes of the different species (i.e., the breaking up of coadapted gene complexes). Detection of such incompatibilities is particularly straightforward in haplodiploid species, because virgin F(1) hybrid females will produce haploid recombinant F(2) males. This feature allows for screening of the complete genome for recessive genetic incompatibilities. Crosses were performed between Nasonia vitripennis (v) and its sibling species N. giraulti (g). First, a linkage map was produced using RAPD markers. RAPD markers showed an overall bias toward vitripennis alleles, a pattern not predicted by the basic two-interactor Dobzhansky-Muller model. Recovery patterns of visible markers were consistent with those of linked RAPD markers. If particular genetic interactions between two loci are causing hybrid lethality, then those genotypes should be underrepresented or absent among adult F(2) males. Four sets of significant incompatibilities were detected by performing pairwise comparisons of markers on different chromosomes. Likely explanations for the observed patterns are maternal effect-zygotic gene incompatibilities or clustering of incompatibility loci. Due to the short generation time, advantages of haplodiploidy, and availability of markers, Nasonia promises to be a productive system for investigating the genetics of hybrid inviability.},

abstract = {Selection experiments in the wild have greatly aided our understanding of how selection shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations. However, these experiments have been hindered by the fact that the traits most important to adaptation and speciation may be fixed within populations. Experimental hybridization offers a means to circumvent this problem since crosses can be made between populations or species that differ for the trait of interest. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach, review results from published studies, and suggest strategies for future experiments. Advantages associated with this approach include the ability to ‘‘generate'' variation for traits of interest, as well as the increased sensitivity of selection assays because of the wider range of trait values characteristic of segregating hybrids. Moreover, experimental hybridization can be extended to crosses between near-isogenic lines, allowing the effects of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to be dissected in a well-defined genetic background. Limitations include widespread linkage disequilibrium created by hybridization, possible cosegregation of hybrid incompatibilities, and the large number of variable traits likely to affect hybrid fitnesses. Even with these limitations, this basic approach has been remarkably successful. We now know, for example, that many morphological differences between divergent populations or species are under selection and that the selection gradients may be surprisingly large. Also, small genetic changes in premating barriers may have large effects on assortative mating. With respect to discussions about the role of hybridization in evolution, experiments indicate that some hybrid trait combinations may be advantageous, particularly when the hybrid populations are placed in a new environment. Future studies seem likely to combine selection measurements with genetic mapping of the QTLs underlying the selected traits. Natural hybrid zones hold particular promise for these kinds of studies because the only experimental manipulation required is the removal of small amounts of tissue for genotyping.},

abstract = {Copper is a micronutrient essential for growth due to its role as a cofactor in enzymes involved in respiration, defense against oxidative damage, and iron uptake. Yet too much of a good thing can be lethal, and yeast cells typically do not have tolerance to copper levels much beyond the concentration in their ancestral environment. Here, we report a short-term evolutionary study of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to levels of copper sulfate that are inhibitory to the initial strain. We isolated and identified adaptive mutations soon after they arose, reducing the number of neutral mutations, to determine the first genetic steps that yeast take when adapting to copper. We analyzed 34 such strains through whole-genome sequencing and by assaying fitness within different environments; we also isolated a subset of mutations through tetrad analysis of four lines. We identified a multilayered evolutionary response. In total, 57 single base-pair mutations were identified across the 34 lines. In addition, gene amplification of the copper metallothionein protein, CUP1-1, was rampant, as was chromosomal aneuploidy. Four other genes received multiple, independent mutations in different lines (the vacuolar transporter genes VTC1 and VTC4; the plasma membrane H+-ATPase PMA1; and MAM3, a protein required for normal mitochondrial morphology). Analyses indicated that mutations in all four genes, as well as CUP1-1 copy number, contributed significantly to explaining variation in copper tolerance. Our study thus finds that evolution takes both common and less trodden pathways toward evolving tolerance to an essential, but highly toxic, micronutrient.},

abstract = {Detailed studies of reproductive isolation and how it varies among populations can provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of speciation. Here we investigate how the strength of premating isolation varies between sympatric and allopatric populations of threespine sticklebacks to test a prediction of the hypothesis of reinforcement: that interspecific mate discrimination should be stronger in sympatry than in allopatry. In conducting such tests, it is important to control for ecological character displacement between sympatric species because ecological character divergence may strengthen prezygotic isolation as a by-product. We control for ecological character displacement by comparing mate preferences of females from a sympatric population (benthics) with mate preferences of females from two allopatric populations that most closely resemble the sympatric benthic females in ecology and morphology. No- choice mating trials indicate that sympatric benthic females mate less readily with heterospecific (limnetic) than conspecific (benthic) males, whereas two different populations of allopatric females resembling benthics show no such discrimination. These differences demonstrate reproductive character displacement of benthic female mate choice. Previous studies have established that hybridization between sympatric species occurred in the past in the wild and that hybrid offspring have lower fitness than either parental species, thus providing conditions under which natural selection would favor individuals that do not hybridize. Results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that female mate preferences have evolved as a response to reduced hybrid fitness (reinforcement), although direct effects of sympatry or a biased extinction process could also produce the pattern. Males of the other sympatric species (limnetics) showed a preference for smaller females, in contrast to the inferred ancestral preference for larger females, suggesting reproductive character displacement of limnetic male mate preferences as well.},

The green 'coat' of the world's mountains is composed of specialized plants, animals and microbes, all nested in a great variety of microhabitats. Because a single mountain may host a series of climatically different life zones over short elevational distances, mountains are hot spots of biodiversity and priority regions for conservation. With their diverse root systems, plants anchor soils on slopes and prevent erosion. Both landuse and atmospheric changes such as elevated CO2 and climatic warming affect mountain biodiversity. Sustained catchment value depends on sustained soil integrity, which in turn depends on a diverse plant cover. Whether landuse in mountains is sustainable is a question of its consequences for water yield and biodiversity. Given their dependence on mountains, lowlanders should show concern for the highlands beyond their recreational value.},

abstract = {Humans challenge the phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of species by affecting the fitness landscapes on which they evolve. Recent studies show that cities might play a major role in contemporary evolution by accelerating phenotypic changes in wildlife, including animals, plants, fungi, and other organisms. Many studies of ecoevolutionary change have focused on anthropogenic drivers, but none of these studies has specifically examined the role that urbanization plays in ecoevolution or explicitly examined its mechanisms. This paper presents evidence on the mechanisms linking urban development patterns to rapid evolutionary changes for species that play important functional roles in communities and ecosystems. Through a metaanalysis of experimental and observational studies reporting more than 1,600 phenotypic changes in species across multiple regions, we ask whether we can discriminate an urban signature of phenotypic change beyond the established natural baselines and other anthropogenic signals. We then assess the relative impact of five types of urban disturbances including habitat modifications, biotic interactions, habitat heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and social interactions. Our study shows a clear urban signal; rates of phenotypic change are greater in urbanizing systems compared with natural and nonurban anthropogenic systems. By explicitly linking urban development to traits that affect ecosystem function, we can map potential ecoevolutionary implications of emerging patterns of urban agglomerations and uncover insights for maintaining key ecosystem functions upon which the sustainability of human well-being depends.},

abstract = {Genetic correlations between traits determine the multivariate response to selection in the short term, and thereby play a causal role in evolutionary change. While individual studies have documented environmentally induced changes in genetic correlations, the nature and extent of environmental effects on multivariate genetic architecture across species and environments remain largely uncharacterized. We reviewed the literature for estimates of the genetic variance-covariance (G) matrix in multiple environments, and compared differences in G between environments to the divergence in G between conspecific populations (measured in a common garden). We found that the predicted evolutionary trajectory differed as strongly between environments as it did between populations. Between-environment differences in the underlying structure of G (total genetic variance and the relative magnitude and orientation of genetic correlations) were equal to or greater than between-population differences. Neither environmental novelty nor the difference in mean phenotype predicted these differences in G. Our results suggest that environmental effects on multivariate genetic architecture may be comparable to the divergence that accumulates over dozens or hundreds of generations between populations. We outline avenues of future research to address the limitations of existing data and characterize the extent to which lability in genetic correlations shapes evolution in changing environments.

abstract = {Herbivorous insects use diverse feeding strategies to obtain nutrients from their host plants. Rather than acting as passive victims in these interactions, plants respond to herbivory with the production of toxins and defensive proteins that target physiological processes in the insect. Herbivore-challenged plants also emit volatiles that attract insect predators and bolster resistance to future threats. This highly dynamic form of immunity is initiated by the recognition of insect oral secretions and signals from injured plant cells. These initial cues are transmitted within the plant by signal transduction pathways that include calcium ion fluxes, phosphorylation cascades, and, in particular, the jasmonate pathway, which plays a central and conserved role in promoting resistance to a broad spectrum of insects. A detailed understanding of plant immunity to arthropod herbivores will provide new insights into basic mechanisms of chemical communication and plant-animal coevolution and may also facilitate new approaches to crop protection and improvement.},

abstract = {Molecular adaptation is typically assumed to proceed by sequential fixation of beneficial mutations. In diploids, this picture presupposes that for most adaptive mutations, the homozygotes have a higher fitness than the heterozygotes. Here, we show that contrary to this expectation, a substantial proportion of adaptive mutations should display heterozygote advantage. This feature of adaptation in diploids emerges naturally from the primary importance of the fitness of heterozygotes for the invasion of new adaptive mutations. We formalize this result in the framework of Fisher's influential geometric model of adaptation. We find that in diploids, adaptation should often proceed through a succession of short-lived balanced states that maintain substantially higher levels of phenotypic and fitness variation in the population compared with classic adaptive walks. In fast-changing environments, this variation produces a diversity advantage that allows diploids to remain better adapted compared with haploids despite the disadvantage associated with the presence of unfit homozygotes. The short-lived balanced states arising during adaptive walks should be mostly invisible to current scans for long-term balancing selection. Instead, they should leave signatures of incomplete selective sweeps, which do appear to be common in many species. Our results also raise the possibility that balancing selection, as a natural consequence of frequent adaptation, might play a more prominent role among the forces maintaining genetic variation than is commonly recognized.},

abstract = {Convergent evolution, in which populations produce similar phenotypes in response to similar selection pressure, is strong evidence for the role of natural selection in shaping biological diversity. In some cases, closely related populations can produce functionally similar but phenotypically divergence forms in response to selection. Functional convergence with morphological divergence has been observed in laboratory selection experiments and computer simulations, but while potentially common, is rarely recognized in nature. Here, we present data from the North Pacific threespine stickleback radiation showing that ecologically and functionally similar, but morphologically divergent phenotypes rapidly evolved when an ancestral population colonized freshwater benthic habitats in parallel. In addition, we show that in this system, functional convergence substantially increases morphospace occupation relative to ancestral phenotypes, which suggests that convergent evolution may, paradoxically, be an important and previously underappreciated source of morphological diversity.},

abstract = {Homoploid hybrid speciation occurs through stabilization of a hybrid segregate (or segregates) isolated by premating and/or postmating barriers from parent taxa. Theory predicts that ecological and spatial isolation are of critical importance during homoploid hybrid speciation, and all confirmed homoploid hybrid species are ecologically isolated from their parents. Until recently, such species have been identified long after they originated, and consequently it has not been possible to determine the relative importance of spatial and ecological isolation during their origin. Here we present evidence for the recent origin (within the past 300 years) of a new homoploid hybrid species, Senecio squalidus (Asteraceae), in the British Isles, following long-distance dispersal of hybrid material from a hybrid zone between S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius on Mount Etna, Sicily, Italy. Historical records show that such hybrid material from Sicily was introduced to the Oxford Botanic Garden in Britain in the early part of the 18th century and that S. squalidus began to spread from there after approximately 90 years. A survey of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA/intersimple sequence repeats (RAPD/ISSR) marker variation demonstrated that S. squalidus is a diploid hybrid derivative of S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius that grow at high and low altitudes, respectively, on Mount Etna and that form a hybrid zone at intermediate altitudes. Senecio squalidus contained 11 of 13 RAPD/ISSR markers that were recorded at high frequency in S. chrysanthemifolius but were absent or occurred at low frequency in S. aethnensis, and 10 of 13 markers for which the reverse was true. Bayesian admixture analysis showed that all individuals of S. squalidus surveyed were of mixed ancestry with relatively high mean proportions of ancestry derived from both S. chrysanthemifolius and S. aethnensis (0.644 and 0.356, respectively). We argue that long-distance isolation of hybrid material from its parents on Mount Etna would have helped favor the origin and establishment of S. squalidus in the British Isles, regardless of whether the initial hybrid material introduced to Britain was preadapted to local conditions.},

abstract = {Plants interact with many visitors who consume a variety of plant tissues. While the consequences of herbivory to leaves and shoots are well known, the implications of florivory, the consumption of flowers prior to seed coat formation, have received less attention. Herbivory and florivory can yield different plant, population and community outcomes; thus, it is critical to distinguish between these two types of consumption. Here, we consider the ecological and evolutionary consequences of florivory. A growing number of studies recognize that florivory is common in natural systems and in some cases surpasses leaf herbivory in magnitude and impact. Florivores can affect male and female plant fitness via direct trophic effects and through altered pathways of species interactions. In particular, florivory can affect pollination and have consequences for plant mating and floral sexual system evolution. Plants are not defenceless against florivore damage. Concepts of resistance and tolerance can be applied to plant-florivore interactions. Moreover, extant theories of plant chemical defence, including optimal defence theory, growth rate hypothesis and growth differentiation-balance hypothesis, can be used to make testable predictions about when and how plants should defend flowers against florivores. The majority of the predictions remain untested, but they provide a theoretical foundation on which to base future experiments. The approaches to studying florivory that we outline may yield novel insights into floral and defence traits not illuminated by studies of pollination or herbivory alone.},

abstract = {The importance of epistasis--non-additive interactions between alleles--in shaping population fitness has long been a controversial topic, hampered in part by lack of empirical evidence. Traditionally, epistasis is inferred on the basis of non-independence of genotypic values between loci for a given trait. However, epistasis for fitness should also have a genomic footprint. To capture this signal, we have developed a simple approach that relies on detecting genotype ratio distortion as a sign of epistasis, and we apply this method to a large panel of Drosophila melanogaster recombinant inbred lines. Here we confirm experimentally that instances of genotype ratio distortion represent loci with epistatic fitness effects; we conservatively estimate that any two haploid genomes in this study are expected to harbour 1.15 pairs of epistatically interacting alleles. This observation has important implications for speciation genetics, as it indicates that the raw material to drive reproductive isolation is segregating contemporaneously within species and does not necessarily require, as proposed by the Dobzhansky-Muller model, the emergence of incompatible mutations independently derived and fixed in allopatry. The relevance of our result extends beyond speciation, as it demonstrates that epistasis is widespread but that it may often go undetected owing to lack of statistical power or lack of genome-wide scope of the experiments.},

Method of analysis: We estimated the age of each node in the phylogeny using penalized likelihood, calibrated with multiple fossil dates. We then regressed the average body size and hybrid viability at each phylogenetic node against the node's age. Residuals from these regressions were compared to test for time-independent relationships between body size divergence and post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Conclusions: Morphologically divergent species tend to experience stronger post-zygotic reproductive isolation than expected given their age. These results suggest that morphological divergence between species is associated with an accelerated accumulation of genetic incom- patibilities, and highlight one potential avenue by which ecological divergence may facilitate speciation.},

Thus far, plant defense theory and data have far outpaced knowledge of herbivore offense. Offensive tactics include feed- ing and oviposition choices, enzymatic metabolism of plant compounds, sequestration, morphological adaptations, symbionts, induction of plant galls, and induced plant sus- ceptibility, trenching, and gregarious feeding. We propose that offensive tactics can be categorized usefully depending upon when they are effective and whether they are plas- tic or fixed traits. The advantages of offensive traits have not been adequately described in terms of herbivore fitness. Similarly, a more complete understanding of the costs and limitations of offensive traits will help put the herbivore back in plant-herbivore interactions and coevolution.},

abstract = {Genomic and genetic methods allow investigation of how frequently the same genes are used by different populations during adaptive evolution, yielding insights into the predictability of evolution at the genetic level. We estimated the probability of gene reuse in parallel and convergent phenotypic evolution in nature using data from published studies. The estimates are surprisingly high, with mean probabilities of 0.32 for genetic mapping studies and 0.55 for candidate gene studies. The probability declines with increasing age of the common ancestor of compared taxa, from about 0.8 for young nodes to 0.1-0.4 for the oldest nodes in our study. Probability of gene reuse is higher when populations begin from the same ancestor (genetic parallelism) than when they begin from divergent ancestors (genetic convergence). Our estimates are broadly consistent with genomic estimates of gene reuse during repeated adaptation to similar environments, but most genomic studies lack data on phenotypic traits affected. Frequent reuse of the same genes during repeated phenotypic evolution suggests that strong biases and constraints affect adaptive evolution, resulting in changes at a relatively small subset of available genes. Declines in the probability of gene reuse with increasing age suggest that these biases diverge with time.},

In contrast, the other compounds without the carboline were less active in reducing aphid acceptance. In a probing bioassay, individual substances were either neutral or stimulatory to aphids, indicating that the reduced settling was probably not due to direct effects on aphids, but rather due to effects on the plant. This was confirmed in olfactometer assays, in which aphids were repelled by odors from barley plants following treatment with a mixture containing all four chemicals.},

Since the advent of molecular tools, hybridization has increasingly been recognized as both a common and an evolutionarily important process. Using single nucleotide polymorphism markers from three nuclear genes, we investigated the extent of hybridization between two terrestrial salamanders (Plethodon cinereus and P. electromorphus) at 13 sites in northeastern Ohio, U.S.A. These markers indicated a high degree of gene flow and introgression in these two species (48 of 90 individuals genotyped were classified as hybrids using a Bayesian assignment algorithm). These hybrids included F 1 individuals and backcrosses to both species. These data as well as mitochondrial DNA sequences from hybrids suggest symmetrical hybridization. A multivariate analysis of standard morphological characters and coloration patterns from image analysis demonstrated that hybrids are intermediate in many ways. However, backcrosses proved difficult to separate from parentals, and the extent of hybridization would have been underestimated using morphology and coloration alone. Given the high frequency of hybrids and their broad geographic distribution, we speculate that these two lineages may be in the process of merging back into a single gene pool. H},

Songs of F1, F2, and backcross hybrids were intermediate between those of both parental species in terms phrase number and duration. In contrast, species-specific syllable structure within phrases was largely lost in hybrids and was produced, if at all, in an irregular and imperfect manner. These divergences in inheritance of different song parameters are likely the result of incompatibility of neuronal networks that control stridulatory leg movements in hybrids. It is highly probable that songs of hybrid males are unattractive to females of either parental species because they are intermediate in terms of phrase duration and lack a clear syllable structure. Males of various hybrid types (F1, F2, and backcrosses) are behaviorally sterile because their songs fail to attract mates.},

abstract = {Abstract The extent to which populations experiencing shared selective pressures adapt through a shared genetic response is relevant to many questions in evolutionary biology. In this article, we explore how standing genetic variation contributes to convergent genetic responses in a geographically spread population. Geographically limited dispersal slows the spread of each selected allele, hence allowing other alleles to spread before any one comes to dominate the population. When selectively equivalent alleles meet, their progress is substantially slowed, dividing the species range into a random tessellation, which can be well understood by analogy to a Poisson process model of crystallization. In this framework, we derive the geographic scale over which an allele dominates and the proportion of adaptive alleles that arise from standing variation. Finally, we explore how negative pleiotropic effects of alleles can bias the subset of alleles that contribute to the species' adaptive response. We apply the results to the malaria-resistance glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase–deficiency alleles, where the large mutational target size makes it a likely candidate for adaptation from deleterious standing variation. Our results suggest that convergent adaptation may be common. Therefore, caution must be exercised when arguing that strongly geographically restricted alleles are the outcome of local adaptation. We close by discussing the implications of these results for ideas of species coherence and the nature of divergence between species.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We used likelihood methods to fit population dynamic models to recruitment data for populations of Mexican bean beetles on soybean varieties with no resistance, constitutive resistance, or induced resistance. We compared model configurations that fit parameters for resistance types separately to models that did not account for resistance type. Models representing the hypothesis that the three resistance types differed in their effects on beetle dynamics received the most support. Induced resistance resulted in lower population growth rates and stronger density dependence than no resistance. Constitutive resistance resulted in lower population growth rates and stronger density dependence than induced resistance. Constitutive resistance had a stronger effect on both short-term beetle recruitment and predicted beetle population dynamics than induced resistance. The results of this study suggest that induced and constitutive resistance can differ in their effects on herbivore populations even in a relatively complex system.},

abstract = {1) The eyes of Fsub1/sub-hybrids of two cave populations of Astyanax mexicanus (Anoptichthys hubbsi and A. antrobius) were examined anatomically. Their average sizes are greater than those of the parental forms. 2) As observed in the parental forms, there are also correlations between total size and degree of differentiation of eyes of Fsub1/sub-hybrids. The largest are characterized by features which none of the parental forms possess (remains of outer nuclear and outer reticular layers, horizontal cells, lens rudiments). 3) This proves again that the eye is a developmental unit, whose various structures are interdependent and whose degree of differentiation is correlated with size. Both are less dependent on which particular eye genes are present than on how many eye genes there are. 4) As regards structure and size, the eyes of both parental forms exhibit practically no differences. Both cave populations possess more or less the same number of eye genes. The enlarged eye size of Fsub1/sub-hybrids demonstrates that both cave populations possess a rudimentary eye gene system, which because of separate evolution is partly non-allelic. 5 a) Random mutations are the basis of evolutionary processes, the number of degenerative ones thereby being higher than that of constructive ones. This must be interpreted as caused by the fact that within a balanced genic system, for example, as exhibited by the genic basis of eye development, rise of disorder is far more likely than persistence of order. b) Usually degenerative mutations are eliminated by selection. In the case of an organ which has lost its function, however, it is not subjected to selection. Thus neither constructive nor degenerative mutations get lost. On account of their large number, degenerative mutations cause a preponderantly regressive development of the organs concerned. c) The type of reduction is determined by developmental interdependence within and between all structures of an organ. It is not the kind but the number of degenerative mutations which is decisive in determining the degree of differentiation and correlated size of an organ. d) Organs in which reduction has started are characterized by variability. This is diminished when at the end of a degenerative process there are only genes left which are connected pleiotropically to others. Rapidity of reduction which is probably high on account of the possibility of all mutations-the whole raw material of evolution-becoming expressed, is now diminished. A rudiment which is almost completely homozygous now will persist for a long time.},

abstract = {The timing of herbivory may have important consequences to components of plant fitness as well as the growth rate and persistence of plant populations. Specifically, this study examines whether the timing of herbivory, by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) affects the Population dynamics of the long-lived herb, Trillium grandiflorum. This study combines results from a clipping experiment with demographic matrix modeling in four different T. grandiflorum populations to determine how both the frequency and timing of herbivory alter the population growth rate. Herbivory early, but not late in the season, increased the probability that reproductive plants fail to reproduce in the next year. Both early and late season herbivory resulted in a complete loss of reproductive success in the cur-rent year. Because the growth rates of these Populations were sensitive to changes in the fate of reproductive plants, but insensitive to changes in annual fecundity, early season herbivory was more detrimental to population growth rates than late season herbivory. Plant persistence may depend as much on the timing of herbivory as it does its frequency.},

abstract = {DNA barcoding and DNA taxonomy have recently been proposed as solutions to the crisis of taxonomy and received significant attention from scientific journals, grant agencies, natural history museums, and mainstream media. Here, we test two key claims of molecular taxonomy using 1333 mitochondrial COI sequences for 449 species of Diptera. We investigate whether sequences can be used for species identification ("DNA barcoding") and find a relatively low success rate ({\textless} 70{\%}) based on tree-based and newly proposed species identification criteria. Misidentifications are due to wide overlap between intra- and interspecific genetic variability, which causes 6.5{\%} of all query sequences to have allospecific or a mixture of allo- and conspecific (3.6{\%}) best-matching barcodes. Even when two COI sequences are identical, there is a 6{\%} chance that they belong to different species. We also find that 21{\%} of all species lack unique barcodes when consensus sequences of all conspecific sequences are used. Lastly, we test whether DNA sequences yield an unambiguous species-level taxonomy when sequence profiles are assembled based on pairwise distance thresholds. We find many sequence triplets for which two of the three pairwise distances remain below the threshold, whereas the third exceeds it; i.e., it is impossible to consistently delimit species based on pairwise distances. Furthermore, for species profiles based on a 3{\%} threshold, only 47{\%} of all profiles are consistent with currently accepted species limits, 20{\%} contain more than one species, and 33{\%} only some sequences from one species; i.e., adopting such a DNA taxonomy would require the redescription of a large proportion of the known species, thus worsening the taxonomic impediment. We conclude with an outlook on the prospects of obtaining complete barcode databases and the future use of DNA sequences in a modern integrative taxonomy.},

We tested a mechanism of selection for reduced bony armour in freshwater by tracking genotype and allele frequency changes at an underlying major locus (Ectodysplasin) in transplanted stickleback populations. We inferred disruptive selection on genotypes at the same locus in a population polymorphic for bony armour. Finally, we compared the distribution of phenotypic effect sizes of genes underlying changes in body shape with that predicted by models of adaptive peak shifts following colonization of freshwater. Studies of the effects of selection on genes complement efforts to identify the molecular basis of adaptive differences, and improve our understanding of phenotypic evolution.},

The newest addition in MEGA5 is a collection of maximum likelihood (ML) analyses for inferring evolutionary trees, selecting best-fit substitution models (nucleotide or amino acid), inferring ancestral states and sequences (along with probabilities), and estimating evolutionary rates site-by-site. In computer simulation analyses, ML tree inference algorithms in MEGA5 compared favorably with other software packages in terms of computational efficiency and the accuracy of the estimates of phylogenetic trees, substitution parameters, and rate variation among sites. The MEGA user interface has now been enhanced to be activity driven to make it easier for the use of both beginners and experienced scientists. This version of MEGA is intended for the Windows platform, and it has been configured for effective use on Mac OS X and Linux desktops.

Two methods were used: the first one was vacuum infiltration of intact leaf cells, followed by centrifugation. A significant amount of linamarase and $\beta$-glucosidase activity could be extracted from intact tissue by a 0.25 M NaCl solution, indicating that these activities are localized in the apoplast. The second method, immuno-cytofluorescense of microtome sections, confirmed this. It was found that linamarase and other $\beta$-glucosidases are present in the cell walls, especially those of the epidermal cells, and in the cuticle. However their presence in the cell walls of other tissues i.e. walls of the vessels, could not be excluded. No difference in distribution could be detected between linamarase and other $\beta$-glucosidases.},

We sequenced the second intron of LFY to help resolve relationships within the clade where the internal transcribed spacer and chloroplast markers had previously failed to do so. Divergence time estimation and biogeographic analyses over the posterior distribution of dated trees suggest that a widespread ancestor was distributed across the Northern Hemisphere some 7-17 million years ago. Asian species form a sister group to a clade in which the European species are sister to the North American species. We use climatic niche modeling and divergence time estimates to explore the evolution of climate variables in the group. Principal component analyses help to identify instances of convergence, especially between distantly related species in the Mediterranean basin and in the chaparral of California. We document several cases of significant divergence between sister species in eastern North America and western North America. Climatic models were projected from one continent into the others (e.g., North American species projected into Asia and Europe) to examine whether species living in these areas occupy similar climates. This study demonstrates the utility of combining niche modeling with historical biogeographic analyses and documents significant climatic niche evolution within a group of species distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. These results suggest a possible model for the origin of the Madrean-Tethyan disjunction pattern.},

abstract = {Understanding the evolution of reproductive isolation is tantamount to describing the origin of species. Therefore, a primary goal in evolutionary biology is to identify which reproductive barriers are most important to the process. To achieve this goal, the strength of multiple forms of isolation must be compared in an equivalent manner. However, a diversity of methods has been used to estimate barrier strength, falling into several mathematically distinct categories. This study provides a unified method for calculating isolation that relates the amount of gene flow experienced by taxa to random expectations in a simple linear framework. This approach has three distinct advantages over previous methods: (1) it is directly related to gene flow, (2) it is symmetrical, such that measures in both the positive and negative range are comparable, and (3) it is equivalent between broad categories of reproductive isolation, allowing for appropriate comparisons. This linear formulation can be adjusted for use in all forms of isolation, and can accommodate cases in which null expectations for con- and heterospecific gene flow differ. Additionally, this framework can be used to calculate total reproductive isolation and the relative contributions of individual barriers.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

The result has been numerous new insights into the genomic and genetic consequences of polyploidy. The plethora of new discoveries has dramatically reshaped traditional views and concomitantly revealed that polyploidy is a highly dynamic and ubiquitous process. These recent advances in our understanding of polyploidy have stimulated numerous reviews, most focused on the various genetic, epigenetic, and genomic consequences of polyploid evolution. Whereas genetic and genomic attributes of polyploidization have received considerable attention, other crucial areas of polyploid evolution have received much less (e.g., ecology, pollination biology, physiology). The focus of this paper is not to review again recent discoveries, but to emphasize what we do not yet know about polyploidy, which despite all that has been learned about genome doubling is still an enormous amount. Our list is not meant to be comprehensive, but includes a range of topics that we have placed in several general categories, including mode of formation, ecological and physiological consequences, and genomic rules. Questions include: What is (are) the most frequent mechanism(s) of polyploidization? What factors promote/facilitate polyploidization? What factors favor autopolyploid vs. allopolyploid formation? Do multiple origins result in lineages with differing evolutionary trajectories and/or cryptic species? Our major goals are to stimulate discussion and promote further research.},

Like visual cues, floral electric fields exhibit variations in pattern and structure, which can be discriminated by bumblebees. We also show that such electric field information contributes to the complex array of floral cues that together improve a pollinator's memory of floral rewards.

Data from rDNA sequences support the monophyly of the section, including M. parishii, but provide little support for relationships within it. Analyses using AFLP data resulted in a well-supported hypothesis of relationships among all Erythranthe species. Our second goal was to reconstruct ancestral pollination syndromes and ancestral states of individual characters associated with hummingbird-pollinated flowers. Both parsimony and likelihood approaches indicate that hummingbird pollination evolved twice in Erythranthe from insect-pollinated ancestors. Our reconstruction of individual characters indicates that corolla color and some aspects of corolla shape change states at the same point on the phylogenetic tree as the switch to hummingbird pollination; however, a switch to secretion of high amounts of nectar does not.

Indeed, it seems reasonable to conclude that the vast majority of impacts of artificial night- time lighting stem from effects on biological timings. This adds support to arguments that artificial nighttime lighting has a quite pervasive and marked impact on ecological systems, that the rapid expansion in the global extent of both direct illuminance and skyglow is thus of significant concern, and that a widespread implementation of mitigation measures is required.},

Analysis of the genetic correlations between characters revealed that there were at least four different polygenic genetic systems, governing flowering time, size of flower, number of spots on the corolla, and general size. An analysis of minimum gene number suggested that there were at least 3-7 genes controlling floral size, and a different three controlling floral spot number. Two other characters, corolla lobe shape and stem color, were produced by independent major gene differences. Annuality was also shown to be heritable. The two species appear to utilize the same gene for copper tolerance. The results are discussed in the light of current theories of speciation.},

abstract = {Genetic structure of the large Japanese field mouse populations in suburban landscape of West Tokyo, Japan was determined using mitochondrial DNA control region sequence. Samples were collected from six habitats linked by forests and green tract along the Tama River, and from two forests segregated by urban areas from those continuous habitats. Thirty-five haplotypes were detected in 221 animals. Four to eight haplotypes were found within each local population belonging to the continuous landscape. Some haplotypes were shared by two or three adjacent local populations. On the other hand, two isolated habitats were occupied by one or two indigenous haplotypes. Significant genetic differentiation between all pairs of local populations, except for one pair in the continuous habitats, was found by analysis of molecular variance (amova). The geographical distance between habitats did not explain the large variance of pairwise F(ST)-values among local populations. F(ST)-values between local populations segregated by urban areas were higher than those between local populations in the continuous habitat, regardless of geographical distance. The results of this study demonstrated quantitatively that urban areas inhibit the migration of Apodemus speciosus, whereas a linear green tract along a river functions as a corridor. Moreover, it preserves the metapopulation structure of A. speciosus as well as the corridors in suburban landscape.},

One method is based on estimating FST from frequencies at polymorphic sites, treating each site as a separate locus. The other method is based on computing the minimum number of migration events consistent with the gene tree inferred from their sequences. We compared the performance of these two methods on data that were generated by a computer simulation program that assumed the infinite sites model of mutation and that assumed an island model of migration. We found that in general when there is no recombination, the cladistic method performed better than FST while the reverse was true for rates of recombination similar to those found in eukaryotic nuclear genes, although FST performed better for all recombination rates for very low levels of migration (Nm = 0.1).},

abstract = {1. While previous studies have demonstrated rapid evolution in introduced plants and animals, most focus on single species. They are therefore unable to show whether these are special cases, or if rapid evolution is a common phenomenon in introduced species. 2. We used over 1900 herbarium specimens to determine whether morphological traits [plant height, leafmass per area (LMA), leaf area or leaf shape] have shown significant change during the last ?150 years in 23 plant species introduced to New SouthWales, Australia. 3. Seventy per cent of our study species showed a change in at least one trait through time. The most common change was in plant height (eight out of21 species). Six ofthese showed a decrease in height through time. Decreases in height mainly occurred in western New South Wales where dry, low nutrient conditions may favour shorter plants. We also found changes in leaf traits, including one decrease in LMA, five changes in leaf shape, and three changes in leaf area. The magnitude of these changes was surprisingly large, up to 125{\%} in 100 years. 4. We used specimens of both native Australian species, and of the introduced species taken from their native range to investigate the possibility that the morphological changes were a response to temporal environmental change rather than to the species' introduction to Australia. These control species showed significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) fewer changes than the introduced species. We included in our analyses information on the region in which each specimen was collected, to account for the possibility that changes through time might be caused by populations radiating in to new environ- ments where a different phenotype might be expressed. Overall, rapid evolution seems the most likely explanation for the changes we observed. 5. Synthesis. The majority ofour study species showed morphological change through time. While common garden experiments will be required to rule out phenotypic plasticity as an alternative explanation for these patterns, our results suggest that rapid evolution in introduced plant species could be much more common, and ofa much greater magnitude than previously thought.},

abstract = {Host-associated mating is crucial in maintaining the partial reproductive isolation between the host races of Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae), a fly that forms galls on Solidago altissima and S. gigantea. (We refer to flies reared from S. gigantea as gigantea flies and those reared from S. altissima as altissima flies.) We measured the host preference of males and females of both host races, F1 hybrids between the host races, F2, and backcrosses to both host races. Male and female altissima flies and female gigantea flies had high host fidelity, whereas male gigantea flies had low host fidelity. This result suggests that there may be gene flow between the host races due to nonassortative mating that occurs when male gigantea mate with altissima females on S. altissima. This indicates assortative-mating mechanisms in addition to host-associated mating are required to produce the partial reproductive isolation between the host races that has been observed. Nongenetic factors had no influence on host preference. Larval conditioning did not influence host preference: reciprocal F1 hybrids reared in S. altissima and S. gigantea both preferred S. gigantea. Adult experience had no impact on host preference: females preferred their natal host plant regardless of which host they encountered first as an adult. The hypothesis that maternal effects influence preferences was rejected because male and female flies did not show a consistent preference for the host plant of their mother. We also found no evidence that preference was a sex-linked trait because F1 and backcrosses to the host races with different combinations of X chromosomes from the two host races preferred S. gigantea. Our results indicate that host preference is not determined by a large number of genes because preference of hybrids did not correspond to the proportion of the genome derived from each host race. The strength of the ovipuncture preference for S. gigantea by gigantea females, the females of both reciprocal F1 hybrids, the backcross to gigantea, and F2s indicates that preference is inherited nonadditively at a limited number of loci. The F1 female hybrids, however, had a weaker host preference for S. gigantea than the pure gigantea host race, indicating that there may be incomplete dominance or modifier loci. Males had different host preference patterns than females, with individual male gigantea and male F1 hybrids usually exhibiting preference exclusively for S. gigantea or S. altissima. One hypothesis explaining the difference in host preference between males and females is that the same gene influences both female and male host preference, but it is a sex-influenced gene. Thus, males carrying the gene for S. gigantea preference have an intermediate host preference, whereas females have a strong host preference to S. gigantea. In summary, we found that the host preference that produces host-associated mating is inherited nonadditively at a relatively small number of loci on autosomal genes. This mode of inheritance meets the assumptions of models of sympatric speciation, indicating that the host races could have evolved in sympatry.},

abstract = {Using a weak migration and weak mutation approximation, I studied the average waiting time to parapatric speciation. The description of reproductive isolation used is based on the classical Dobzhansky model and its recently proposed multilocus generalizations. The dynamics of parapatric speciation are modelled as a biased random walk performed by the average genetic distance between the residents and immigrants. If a small number of genetic changes is sufficient for complete reproductive isolation, mutation and random genetic drift alone can cause speciation on the time-scale of ten to 1,000 times the inverse of the mutation rate over a set of loci underlying reproductive isolation. Even relatively weak selection for local adaptation can dramatically decrease the waiting time to speciation. The actual duration of the parapatric speciation process (that is the duration of intermediate forms in the actual transition to a state of complete reproductive isolation) is shorter by orders of magnitude than the overall waiting time to speciation. For a wide range of parameter values, the actual duration of parapatric speciation is of the order of one over the mutation rate. In general, parapatric speciation is expected to be triggered by changes in the environment.},

abstract = {A venerable view of speciation is that reproductive isolation ultimately evolves from contrasting selection pressures between populations exploiting different resource environments. Yet, this `ecological' mode of species origins has been tested rarely in nature. Here I describe emerging evidence of divergent selection and speciation in fishes of postglacial lakes. Examples of very closely related species pairs within such lakes are known from over a dozen independent fish lineages. These pairs display four remarkable attributes which together raise the possibility of ecological speciation: rapid evolution of assortative mating in sympatry and/or allopatry; persistence in sympatry despite a history of gene flow; a high degree of niche differentiation (usually one species is planktivorous and the other is benthic) accompanied by differences in body size and shape; and high intrinsic viability and fertility of interspecific hybrids. More direct evidence for ecological speciation comes from preliminary confirmation of three predictions: selection against hybrids has an ecological basis (morphologically intermediate hybrid sticklebacks have a reduced ability to exploit the main resources on which the parent species are specialized); premating isolation is linked to the morphological traits that have diverged between species (hybridization in sticklebacks occurs only between the morphologically most similar individuals of the two parent species); premating isolation mechanisms evolve in parallel in similar environments (interspecific mate preferences appear to have diverged in parallel in stickleback species pairs that evolved independently). These findings argue that knowledge of ecological environments is essential to understanding the origin of species in adaptive radiation, and perhaps more generally. Field studies of selection on traits determining reproductive isolation are sorely needed, and would complement (and perhaps transform) traditional genetic approaches to speciation.},

Hybrid offspring obtained from experimental crosses and hybrids collected from natural populations were heterozygous at four or five out of five diagnostic loci. Shell morphology was a poor predictor of the hybrid status of individual snails. Backcrossed offspring from experimentally bred hybrids and either of the parental species morphologically resembled the parental species. There was no evidence of segregation distortion at the six loci. Linkage analysis revealed one pair of linked loci (GPI and PNP). These cross experiments indicated a Mendelian type hybrid system in which gene introgression may occur. F-1 hybrids were found at four out of six sampling sites of Lake Garda, Italy. Local frequencies of F-1 hybrids ranged from 0{\%} to 1.6{\%} (estimated average = 0.74{\%}) of the total population including both species. Alleles typical of V. ater were found at low frequencies in V. contectus at all six sampling sites. Alleles typical of V. contectus were found at low frequencies in V. ater at three out of six sampling sites. This is consistent with the hypothesis of introgression in both directions.},

abstract = {Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes. Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics is {\$}\backslashtilde r,{\$} the long-run growth rate of a population below K, including stochastic factors. If r̃ is positive, with demographic stochasticity T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K, and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r̃ is negative, under any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically with the logarithm of K. Thus, for sufficiently large populations, the risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes. The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes. Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes can persist for a long time, if r̃ is substantially positive.},

In this study, we use an artificial life platform to directly compare the strength of reproductive isolation (specifically, postzygotic) generated by ecological and mutation-order processes. We also tested the effect of gene flow as well as the dimensionality (i.e., number of selective pressures) of the environments on the strength of postzygotic isolation. We found that ecological speciation generally formed stronger isolation than mutation-order speciation, mutation-order speciation was more sensitive to gene flow than ecological speciation, and environments with high dimensionality formed stronger reproductive isolation than those with low dimensionality. How various factors affect the strength of reproductive isolation has been difficult to test in biological organisms, but the use of artificial life, which provides its own genetic system that evolves, allowed us to computationally test the effect of these factors more easily.},

abstract = {Ongoing climate change has affected the ecological dynamics of many species and is expected to impose natural selection on ecologically important traits. Droughts and other anticipated changes in precipitation may be particularly potent selective factors, especially in arid regions. Here we demonstrate the evolutionary response of an annual plant, Brassica rapa, to a recent climate fluctuation resulting in a multiyear drought. Ancestral (predrought) genotypes were recovered from stored seed and raised under a set of common environments with descendant (postdrought) genotypes and with ancestorxdescendant hybrids. As predicted, the abbreviated growing seasons caused by drought led to the evolution of earlier onset of flowering. Descendants bloomed earlier than ancestors, advancing first flowering by 1.9 days in one study population and 8.6 days in another. The intermediate flowering time of ancestorxdescendant hybrids supports an additive genetic basis for divergence. Experiments confirmed that summer drought selected for early flowering, that flowering time was heritable, and that selection intensities in the field were more than sufficient to account for the observed evolutionary change. Natural selection for drought escape thus appears to have caused adaptive evolution in just a few generations. A systematic effort to collect and store propagules from suitable species would provide biologists with materials to detect and elucidate the genetic basis of further evolutionary shifts driven by climate change.},

A. erigeniae is a specialist on C. virginica, B. major is a common visitor to many plant species.

For those flowers that were successfully pollinated and produced a capsule, number of seeds did not vary with visitor identity or the total number of visits received. Although B. major and female A. erigeniae differ greatly in morphology and foraging behavior, a visit by either insect results in equally high seed set. As B. major is about 2/3 as abundant as A. erigeniae females on C. virginica, both insects contribute substantially to seed set in the population.

abstract = {Population divergence in geographic isolation is due to a combination of factors. Natural and sexual selection may be important in shaping patterns of population differentiation, a pattern referred to as ‘isolation by adaptation' (IBA). IBA can be complementary to the well-known pattern of ‘isolation by distance' (IBD), in which the divergence of closely related populations (via any evolutionary process) is associated with geographic isolation. The barn swallowHirundo rusticacomplex comprises six closely related subspecies, where divergent sexual selection is associated with phenotypic differentiation among allopatric populations. To investigate the relative contributions of selection and geographic distance to genome-wide differentiation, we compared genotypic and phenotypic variation from 350 barn swallows sampled across eight populations (28 pairwise comparisons) from four different subspecies. We report a draft whole-genome sequence for H. rustica, to which we aligned a set of 9493 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using statistical approaches to control for spatial autocorrelation of phenotypic variables and geographic distance, we find that divergence in traits related to migratory behaviour and sexual signalling, as well as geographic distance, together explain over 70{\%} of genome-wide divergence among populations. Controlling for IBD, we find 42{\%} of genomewide divergence is attributable to IBA through pairwise differences in traits related to migratory behaviour and sexual signalling alone. By (i) combining these results with prior studies of how selection shapes morphological differentiation and (ii) accounting for spatial autocorrelation, we infer that morphological adaptation plays a large role in shaping population-level differentiation in this group of closely related populations.},

These bacteria alter insect reproduction in ways that enhance their cytoplasmic transmission. One of the most common alterations is cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) - a post-fertilization modification of the paternal genome that renders embryos inviable or unable to complete diploid development in crosses between infected males and uninfected females or infected females harboring a different strain. The parasitic wasp species complex Nasonia (N. vitripennis, N. longicornis and N. giraulti) harbor at least six different Wolbachia that cause CI. Each species have double infections with a representative from both the A and B Wolbachia subgroups. CI relationships of the A and B Wolbachia of N. longicornis with those of N. giraulti and N. vitripennis are investigated here. We demonstrate that all pairwise crosses between the divergent A strains are bidirectionally incompatible. We were unable to characterize incompatibility between the B Wolbachia, but we establish that the B strain of N. longicornis induces no or very weak CI in comparison to the closely related B strain in N. giraulti that expresses complete CI. Taken together with previous studies, we show that independent acquisition of divergent A Wolbachia has resulted in three mutually incompatible strains, whereas codivergence of B Wolbachia in N. longicornis and N. giraulti is associated with differences in CI level. Understanding the diversity and evolution of new incompatibility strains will contribute to a fuller understanding of Wolbachia invasion dynamics and Wolbachia-assisted speciation in certain groups of insects.},

Moreover, humans have the physiological ability to detoxify cyanide satisfactorily, given an adequate protein diet.

In addition, it was found that the hormone ethylene is involved in regulating antifreeze activity in response to cold. In this review, it is seen that the physiological and biochemical roles of AFPs may be important to protect the plant tissues from mechanical stress caused by ice formation.},

We found that the frequency of cyanogenic plants within populations decreased towards the urban centre in three of four cities. A field experiment indicated that spatial variation in herbivory is unlikely to explain these clines. Rather, colder minimum winter ground temperatures in urban areas compared with non-urban areas, caused by reduced snow cover in cities, may select against cyanogenesis. In the city with no cline, high snow cover might protect plants from freezing damage in the city centre. Our study suggests that populations are adapting to urbanization gradients, but regional climatic patterns may ultimately determine whether adaptation occurs.},

abstract = {The nature of the relationship between Chondrus pinnulatus (Harvey) Okamura f. Pinnulatus and C. Pinnulatus f. Armatus (Harvey) Yamada et Mikami (Gigartinaceae, Rhodophyta) was investigated by comparative analysis of their biogeography, phenologies, life histories, gross and vegetative morphology, crossability, and upper thermal tolerance. The forma pinnulatus has a more northerly distribution in Japan and adjacent waters, exhibiting adaptation to the cooler regions, whereas the forma armatus has a more southerly range. The latter may be the result of a higher thermal tolerance. Both formae have a Polysiphonia-type life history and are similar in their internal vegetative morphology. They can, however, be distinguished by gross morphology: forma pinnulatus has wide, flattened axes, compressed to flattened ultimate segments and proliferations, while forma armatus has narrow, compressed to subterete axes and subterete to terete ultimate segments and proliferations. These differences persist in laboratory culture. All intraformae crosses were positive, with carpospores from the cross developing into fertile F-1 tetrasporophytes releasing tetraspores that developed into dioecious F-1 gametophytes, the female gametophytes of which formed normal cystocarps. This suggests that members of populations of each forma freely interbreed. Among interformae crosses, only some offspring derived from geographically distant strains bore normal cystocarps in the F-1 female gametophytes. Other crosses showed that interbreeding between populations of these two formae was blocked by various isolating mechanisms: incompatibility, hybrid inviability, and hybrid sterility. Reproductive isolation between f. Pinnulatus and f. Armatus is virtually complete in wild populations, because hybrid populations have not been found in the wild. In addition, these two entities can be considered biological species that are also referred to the taxonomic species, C. Armatus and C. Pinnulatus, because they do not overlap with regard to the morphology of the ultimate segments and proliferations. Subtle (but significant) gross morphological differences, partial interfertility between the two species, and deleterious hybridization in the area in which they occur sympatrically suggest that their evolutionary divergence was relatively recent.},

Each of these processes might then have two different effects on biodiversity: changes in the number of taxa through merging or splitting of groups, and the extinction/extirpation of taxa through effects on fitness. We review the various ways in which humans are affecting genetic exchange, and highlight the difficulties in predicting the impacts on biodiversity. Gene flow and hybridization are crucially important evolutionary forces influencing biodiversity. Humans alter natural patterns of genetic exchange in myriad ways, and these anthropogenic effects are likely to influence the genetic integrity of populations and species.

abstract = {Abstract Speciation research during the last several decades has confirmed that natural selection frequently drives the genera- tion of new species. But how does this process generally unfold in nature? We argue that answering this question requires a clearer conceptual framework for understanding selection's role in speciation. We present a unified framework of speciation, pro- viding mechanistic descriptions of fundamentally distinct routes to speciation, and how these may interact during lineage splitting. Two major categories are recognized: reproductive isolation resulting from (1) responses to selection, “speciation by selection,” or (2) non-selective processes, “speciation without selection.” Speciation by selection can occur via three mechanisms: (1) similar selection, (2) divergent selection, and (3) reinforcement selection. Understanding ecology's role in speciation requires uncovering how these three mechanisms contribute to reproductive isolation, and their relative importance compared to non-selective proce- sses, because all three mechanisms can occur side-by-side during speciation. To accomplish this, we highlight examination of groups of organisms inhabiting replicated environmental gradients. This scenario is common in nature, and a large literature illus- trates that both parallel and non-parallel responses to similar environments are widespread, and each can result in speciation. This recognition reveals four general pathways of speciation by similar or divergent selection—parallel and nonparallel responses to similar and divergent selection. Altogether, we present a more precise framework for speciation research, draw attention to some under-recognized features of speciation, emphasize the multidimensionality of speciation, reveal limitations of some previous tests and descriptions of speciation mechanisms, and point to a number of directions for future investigation},

abstract = {Mountain ecosystems will likely be affected by global warming during the 21st century, with substantial biodiversity loss predicted by species distribution models (SDMs). Depending on the geographic extent, elevation range, and spatial resolution of data used in making these models, different rates of habitat loss have been predicted, with associated risk of species extinction. Few coordinated across-scale comparisons have been made using data of different resolutions and geographic extents. Here, we assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the European scale (10 10' grid cells) are also predicted from local-scale data and modeling (25m 25m grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps. We show that local-scale models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100{\%} of species that were predicted by a European-scale model to lose all their suitable habitats in the area. Proportion of habitat loss depends on climate change scenario and study area. We find good agreement between the mismatch in predictions between scales and the fine-grain elevation range within 10 10' cells. The greatest prediction discrepancy for alpine species occurs in the area with the largest nival zone. Our results suggest elevation range as the main driver for the observed prediction discrepancies. Local-scale projections may better reflect the possibility for species to track their climatic requirement toward higher elevations.},

A common-garden experimental design was coupled with comparative transcriptomics to discover evolved mechanisms enabling three populations of killifish resident in urban estuaries to survive normally lethal pollution exposure during development, and to test whether mechanisms are unique or common across populations. We show that killifish populations from these polluted sites have independently converged on a common adaptive mechanism, despite variation in contaminant profiles among sites. These populations are united by a similarly profound desensitization of aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-mediated transcriptional activation, which is associated with extreme tolerance to the lethal effects of toxic dioxin-like pollutants. The rapid, repeated, heritable and convergent nature of evolved tolerance suggests that ancestral killifish populations harboured genotypes that enabled adaptation to twentieth-century industrial pollutants.},

abstract = {Species coexistence involves the evolution of reproductive barriers opposing gene flow. Heliconius butterflies display colorful patterns affecting mate choice and survival through warning signaling and mimicry. These patterns are called “magic traits” for speciation because divergent natural selection may promote mimicry shifts in pattern whose role as mating cue facilitates reproductive isolation. By contrast, between comimetic species, natural selection promotes pattern convergence. We addressed whether visual convergence interferes with reproductive isolation by testing for sexual isolation between two closely related species with similar patterns, H. timareta thelxinoe and H. melpomene amaryllis. Experiments with models confirmed visual attraction based on wing phenotype, leading to indiscriminate approach. Nevertheless, mate choice experiments showed assortative mating. Monitoring male behavior toward live females revealed asymmetry in male preference, H. melpomene males courting both species equally while H. timareta males strongly preferred conspecifics. Experiments with hybrid males suggested an important genetic component for such asymmetry. Behavioral observations support a key role for short-distance cues in determining male choice in H. timareta. Scents extracts from wings and genitalia revealed interspecific divergence in chemical signatures, and hybrid female scent composition was significantly associated with courtship intensity by H. timareta males, providing candidate chemical mating cues involved in sexual isolation.},

The experiment was performed using a full-additive series design and interpreted with response surface models for each species. As reflected in both aboveground mass and height, Populus suppressed aboveground growth of Tamarix across all treatments, whereas competitive effects of Tamarix against Populus could only be seen at low Populus densities. Clay substrates with draw-down stimulated the greatest growth and created the most intense competitive environment for both species. Tamarix was competitively suppressed in every substrate tested, with the weakest response in sand with no draw-down, where growth of Populus was poorest. These results suggest that stream flow management that promotes Populus establishment could also aid in controlling Tamarix invasion across a range of substrates.},

In addition to revealing patterns in diversity and abundance of herbivores across urbanization gradients, a primary objective of this review is to examine mechanisms underlying these patterns and to identify potential hypotheses for future testing.},

To investigate the relative contribution of these processes, we analysed historical and contemporary data of replicate whitefish radiations from 17 pre-alpine European lakes and reconstructed changes in genetic species differentiation through time using historical samples. Here we provide evidence that species diversity evolved in response to ecological opportunity, and that eutrophication, by diminishing this opportunity, has driven extinctions through speciation reversal and demographic decline. Across the radiations, the magnitude of eutrophication explains the pattern of species loss and levels of genetic and functional distinctiveness among remaining species. We argue that extinction by speciation reversal may be more widespread than currently appreciated. Preventing such extinctions will require that conservation efforts not only target existing species but identify and protect the ecological and evolutionary processes that generate and maintain species.},

abstract = {To determine the patterns of atmospheric deposition and throughfall in the vicinity of a large city, bulk deposition, oak forest throughfall, and particulate dust deposition were measured at sites along a transect within and to the north of New York City. Concentrations and fluxes of NO3-, NH4+,Ca2+,Mg2+,SO42-, and Cl- in throughfall all declined significantly with distance from the city, while hydrogen ion concentration and flux increased with distance from the city. Most of the change in concentrations and fluxes occurred within 45 km of the city. Throughfall deposition of inorganic N was twice as high in the urban sites as com- pared to the suburban and rural sites. Bulk deposition patterns were similar to those of throughfall, but changes along the transect were much less pronounced. The water- extractable component of dust deposition to Petri plates also was substantially higher in the urban sites for Ca2+, Mg2+,SO42-,NO3-, and Cl-. The dust particles had little alkalinity, suggesting that alkaline aerosols were neutralized by acidic gases in the atmosphere. We propose that dust emissions from New York City act like an “urban scrubber”, removing acidic gases from the atmosphere and depositing them on the city as coarse particle dry deposition. Despite the urban scrubber effect, most of the dry deposition of nitrate was from gaseous nitrogen oxides, which were in much higher concentration in the city than in rural sites. Excess deposition of nutrients and pollutants could be important for the nutrient budgets of forests in and near urban areas.},

Over the past three decades, characterizing the genes underlying adaptive phenotypic change has revealed many important aspects of evolutionary change. At the same time, natural selection is often fundamentally an ecological process that can often be studied without identifying the genes underlying the variation on which it acts. This duality has given rise to disagreement about whether, and under what circumstances, it is necessary to identify specific genes associated with phenotypic change. This issue is of practical concern, especially for researchers who study non-model organisms, because of the often enormous cost and labor required to “go for the genes”. We here consider a number of situations and questions commonly addressed by researchers. Our conclusion is that while gene identification can be crucial for answering some questions, there are others for which definitive answers can be obtained without finding underlying genes. It should thus not be assumed that considerations of “empirical completeness” dictate that gene identification is always desirable. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Speciation often involves the evolution of numerous prezygotic and postzygotic isolating barriers between divergent populations. Detailed knowledge of the strength and nature of those barriers provides insight into ecological and genetic factors that directly or indirectly influenced their origin, and may help predict whether they will be maintained in the face of sympatric hybridization and introgression. We estimated the magnitude of pre- and postzygotic barriers between naturally occurring sympatric populations of Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus. Prezygotic barriers, including divergent flowering phenologies, differential pollen production, mating system isolation, and conspecific pollen precedence, act asymmetrically to completely prevent the formation of F(1) hybrids among seeds produced by M. guttatus (F(1)g), and reduce F(1) hybrid production among seeds produced by M. nasutus (F(1)n) to only about 1{\%}. Postzygotic isolation is also asymmetric: in field experiments, F(1)g but not F(1)n hybrids had significantly reduced germination rates and survivorship compared to parental species. Both hybrid classes had flower, pollen, and seed production values within the range of parental values. Despite the moderate degree of F(1)g hybrid inviability, postzygotic isolation contributes very little to the total isolation between these species in the wild. We also found that F(1) hybrid flowering phenology overlapped more with M. guttatus than M. nasutus. These results, taken together, suggest greater potential for introgression from M. nasutus to M. guttatus than for the reverse direction. We also address problems with commonly used indices of isolation, discuss difficulties in calculating meaningful measures of reproductive isolation when barriers are asymmetric, and propose novel measures of prezygotic isolation that are consistent with postzygotic measures.},

On islands with the introduced predator, which forages mostly on the ground, A. sagrei shifted to taller vegetation; unlike on unmanipulated islands, its survival was very low on islands with the shortest vegetation but was higher on the others. Thus, species introduction radically changed a resident species' relation of survival to a key island-biogeographical variable.},

abstract = {Wounding increases the levels and activities of several defense- related proteins in the foliage of the tomato plant, Lycopersicon esculemum Mill. Evidence indicates that two of these responses, the systemic increases in polyphenol oxidase and proteinase inhibitors, are regulated by an octa- decanoid-based signalling pathway which includes the wound hormone, jas- monic acid. It is not known whether other responses to wounding are also regulated by this same signalling pathway. In this paper, we show that appli- cation of jasmonates (jasmonic acid or its volatile derivative, methyl jasmon- ate) in low concentrations to foliage of young tomato plants induced, in a dose-dependent manner, the same protein responses-polyphenol oxidase, pvo- teinase inhibitors, lipoxygenase, and peroxidase-as does Helicoverpa zea Boddie feeding. Application of jasmonic acid to a single leaflet of four-leaf tomato plants induced these lout proteins in a spatial pattern nearly identical to that produced by localized feeding of H. ,zea. Exogenous jasmonic acid also decreased suitability of foliage for the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua Hubner in the laboratory. Based on these results, we conducted an experiment to measure the effects of jasmonic acid spray under field conditions. We provide the first evidence that jasmonic acid spray on field plants induces production of chemical defenses above the levels found in unsprayed controls. Exogenous jasmonic acid sprayed on plants in agricultural plots increased levels of polyphenol oxidase and proteinase inhibitors. Because application of jasmonic acid induces these defensive compounds at low concentrations in a manner similar to natural wounding, it may prove to be a useful tool for stimulating plant resistance to insects in the field.},

Hence, the effective photoperiod inducing larval diapause will differ among geographic ecotypes. This study considers the inheritance of photoperiodic larval diapause induction by hybridization and backcrossing two latitudinally distinct ecotypes of the European corn borer collected between 41° N, 96° W and 48° N, 96° W and under a range of photoperiods representative of their respective locations: from 14:10 to16:8 (L:D) h. The ecotype adapted to a bivoltine habitat (southeastern Nebraska) exhibited a shorter critical photoperiod (1480 h) than the ecotype (1533 h), originating from a univoltine habitat (northwestern Minnesota). Reciprocal F1 crosses exhibited intermediate values with indication of sex-linked inheritance. In addition, the male parent had significantly more influence on diapause incidence of subsequent progeny than the female. The F2 and backcross progeny further supported the supposition that diapause response is a sex-linked inheritance. The minimum number of genes estimates, and the response from backcross progeny, suggest that diapause response of European corn borer larva may be controlled by only a few loci. The overall results indicated that both ecotypes had adopted unique diapause responses, which ultimately lead to seasonal synchrony in their ecosystems.},

We do not recommend using AUC for five reasons: (1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; (2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in which one would rarely operate; (3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; (4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model errors; and, most importantly, (5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.},

Also, A. carolinensis mobile elements are very young and diverse-more so than in any other sequenced amniote genome. The GC content of this lizard genome is also unusual in its homogeneity, unlike the regionally variable GC content found in mammals and birds. We describe and assign sequence to the previously unknown A. carolinensis X chromosome.

abstract = {Genomic comparisons provide evidence for ancient genome-wide duplications in a diverse array of animals and plants. We developed a birth-death model to identify evidence for genome duplication in EST data, and applied a mixture model to estimate the age distribution of paralogous pairs identified in EST sets for species representing the basal-most extant flowering plant lineages. We found evidence for episodes of ancient genome-wide duplications in the basal angiosperm lineages including Nuphar advena (yellow water lily: Nymphaeaceae) and the magnoliids Persea americana (avocado: Lauraceae), Liriodendron tulipifera (tulip poplar: Magnoliaceae), and Saruma henryi (Aristolochiaceae). In addition, we detected independent genome duplications in the basal eudicot Eschscholzia californica (California poppy: Papaveraceae) and the basal monocot Acorus americanus (Acoraceae), both of which were distinct from duplications documented for ancestral grass (Poaceae) and core eudicot lineages. Among gymnosperms, we found equivocal evidence for ancient polyploidy in Welwitschia mirabilis (Gnetales) and no evidence for polyploidy in pine, although gymnosperms generally have much larger genomes than the angiosperms investigated. Cross-species sequence divergence estimates suggest that synonymous substitution rates in the basal angiosperms are less than half those previously reported for core eudicots and members of Poaceae. These lower substitution rates permit inference of older duplication events. We hypothesize that evidence of an ancient duplication observed in the Nuphar data may represent a genome duplication in the common ancestor of all or most extant angiosperms, except Amborella.},

A specific type of parallel speciation, known as parallel ecological speciation, is one of several forms of evidence for ecology's role in speciation. In this paper we search the literature for candidate examples of parallel ecological speciation in plants. We use four explicit criteria (independence, isolation, compatibility, and selection) to judge the strength of evidence for each potential case. We find that evidence for parallel ecological speciation in plants is unexpectedly scarce, especially relative to the many well-characterized systems in animals. This does not imply that ecological speciation is uncommon in plants. It only implies that evidence from parallel ecological speciation is rare. Potential explanations for the lack of convincing examples include a lack of rigorous testing and the possibility that plants are less prone to parallel ecological speciation than animals.},

abstract = {Since Darwin published the "Origin," great progress has been made in our understanding of speciation mechanisms. The early investigations by Mayr and Dobzhansky linked Darwin's view of speciation by adaptive divergence to the evolution of reproductive isolation, and thus provided a framework for studying the origin of species. However, major controversies and questions remain, including: When is speciation nonecological? Under what conditions does geographic isolation constitute a reproductive isolating barrier? and How do we estimate the "importance" of different isolating barriers? Here, we address these questions, providing historical background and offering some new perspectives. A topic of great recent interest is the role of ecology in speciation. "Ecological speciation" is defined as the case in which divergent selection leads to reproductive isolation, with speciation under uniform selection, polyploid speciation, and speciation by genetic drift defined as "nonecological." We review these proposed cases of nonecological speciation and conclude that speciation by uniform selection and polyploidy normally involve ecological processes. Furthermore, because selection can impart reproductive isolation both directly through traits under selection and indirectly through pleiotropy and linkage, it is much more effective in producing isolation than genetic drift. We thus argue that natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation, and given the many ways in which stochastic and deterministic factors may interact during divergence, we question whether the ecological speciation concept is useful. We also suggest that geographic isolation caused by adaptation to different habitats plays a major, and largely neglected, role in speciation. We thus provide a framework for incorporating geographic isolation into the biological species concept (BSC) by separating ecological from historical processes that govern species distributions, allowing for an estimate of geographic isolation based upon genetic differences between taxa. Finally, we suggest that the individual and relative contributions of all potential barriers be estimated for species pairs that have recently achieved species status under the criteria of the BSC. Only in this way will it be possible to distinguish those barriers that have actually contributed to speciation from those that have accumulated after speciation is complete. We conclude that ecological adaptation is the major driver of reproductive isolation, and that the term "biology of speciation," as proposed by Mayr, remains an accurate and useful characterization of the diversity of speciation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Normally outcrossing, pink-flowered, diploid Clarkia xantiana has given rise to two distinct, localized, self-pollinating populations in an ecologically marginal area. These two populations are morphologically very similar, except that one is pink and the other white. The selfers have smaller flowers than the outcrossers, the stigma is mature at anthesis when it is in contact with the dehiscing anthers, the style does not elongate after anthesis, flowering is earlier, and the habitat in which they occur is visibly more xeric. The genomes of the outcrosser and the pink selfer appear to be structurally identical; the hybrids are highly fertile and regularly show nine bivalents at meiosis. The white selfer differs from both of the others by a translocation and hybrids with them have a somewhat lower fertility. The essential change effecting selfpollination has been early maturation of the stigma, which appears to have a simple genetic basis. F2 data also indicate that when the stigma matures the style ceases to elongate, suggesting that the phenomena are causally related. Inheritance of flower size, on the other hand, is multifactorial and not genetically correlated with self-pollination. It is argued that the initial event leading to self-pollination was the reduction of the population to extremely small size during a growing season truncated by water stress, and that the genotypes surviving this catastrophic selection were those produced by the earliest flowering individuals. In a very small population genes promoting self-pollination would be at an advantage. Once established, an inbreeding race would become self-perpetuating. Reduction in flower size followed from relaxed selection for large flowers and positive selection for smaller flowers. The whiteflowered selfer is derived from the pink selfer.},

abstract = {The importance of bird song in sexual selection and the widespread existence of geographical variation in song has raised the question of whether dialects can promote the evolution of new, reproductively isolated, subgroups. However, the effect of song learning on the relation between song divergence and gene flow is still poorly understood. We explored the origin and maintenance of song divergence and its consequences for male dispersal between populations. To do this, we used a spatially explicit model to study the effect of vocal learning mode (predispersal and postdispersal) and the role of intrasexual selection among males. The majority of scenarios simulated in the model led to significant genetic and phenotypic song divergence, consistent with the widespread occurrence of dialects in natural populations. Intrasexual selection in the form of male exclusion, dependent on song matching between neighbours, was an efficient mechanism driving song divergence. Most importantly, song learning was decisive in causing an incongruence of genetic divergence and song divergence between populations. As a consequence, song learning often prevented the expected negative relation between the degree of song divergence and dispersal. These findings may help to interpret empirical data on song divergence and gene flow and provide qualitative and testable predictions for conditions under which intraspecific song variation may promote reproductive divergence and speciation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {In the present investigation, I compare the genetic basis of the dissected leaves characterizing two populations of the annual plant Crepis tectorum in the Baltic region, one on the island of Oland (SE Sweden) and the other in the district of Aland (S Finland). Patterns of segregation in crosses using the same simple-leaved plant as a seed parent demonstrate that finely dissected leaves are completely dominant over weakly lobed leaves, that a single major gene may be responsible for the deeply lobed leaves of the Oland population and that three, perhaps four, major genes control leaf dissection in the Aland population. Different dominant genes may be responsible for leaf dissection in the Aland and Oland populations, as shown by the presence of an entire-leaved plant in the F-2 progeny of a cross between these populations. These results lend further support to the hypothesis that few genetic changes were involved in the shift from weakly to deeply lobed leaves. Field data from the Oland population indicate low penetrance of the single major gene segregating in crosses with simple-leaved populations.},

Therefore, polyploids and plants with larger genomes are expected to be selectively disadvantaged in P-limited environments. However, this hypothesis has yet to be experimentally tested. We measured the somatic DNA content and ploidy level in 74 vascular plant species in a long-term fertilization experiment. The differences between the fertilizer treatments regarding the DNA content and ploidy level of the established species were tested using phylogeny-based statistics. The percentage and biomass of polyploid species clearly increased with soil P in particular fertilizer treatments, and a similar but weaker trend was observed for the DNA content. These increases were associated with the dominance of competitive life strategy (particularly advantageous in the P-treated plots) in polyploids and the enhanced competitive ability of dominant polyploid grasses at high soil P concentrations, indicating their increased P limitation. Our results verify the hypothesized effect of P availability on the selection of polyploids and plants with increased genome sizes, although the relative contribution of increased P demands vs increased competitiveness as causes of the observed pattern requires further evaluation.},

Here, I present data from several crosses (parental crosses, F1s, F2s, back-crosses) between two species of killifish (Lucania goodei and L. parva) that have diverged along a salinity gradient (L. goodei—freshwater, L. parva—euryhaline). Offspring were raised under high and low salinity to test for (1) extrinsic isolation, (2) intrinsic isolation manifested through genetic incompatibilities, and (3) environmentally dependent genetic incompatibilities. I found evidence for both intrinsic and extrinsic isolation, but no evidence for environmentally dependent genetic incompatibilities. The presence of extrinsic and intrinsic isolation varied among fitness measures, and all forms of reproductive isolation were asymmetric. Early egg survival was independent of salinity, but demonstrated pronounced intrinsic isolation. Both extrinsic and intrinsic isolation existed for egg hatching and survival of fry to the eating stage. Unfortunately, the order in which extrinsic and intrinsic isolation arose is unresolved. Understanding the extent to which adaptation to salinity creates multiple forms of reproductive isolation is critical for understanding diversification in many fish taxa.},

Unfortunately, there exist few general guidelines to help practitioners design monitoring programs that reach this balance. Here, we analyse a 33-year monitoring program from Ghana, West Africa, to provide both specific and general suggestions for monitoring in developing countries. Since the late 1960s the Ghana Wildlife Division has monitored more than 40 wildlife species with monthly surveys at sites throughout Ghana's nature reserves. These data present unparalleled opportunities to illuminate the scale and pattern of changes in animal abundance over time and the forces that drive these changes. We used sub-sampling of the Ghana monitoring data for four species in two savanna reserves to identify the minimum level of monitoring necessary to reliably detect changes in wildlife populations over 5-year intervals. We used a similar approach to estimate the minimum sampling needed to infer changes in abundance of hunters in reserves. Our results highlight the relative importance of comprehensive spatial and temporal sampling and suggest a requirement of no less than one monitoring site per every 285 km(2) in large reserves and 65 km(2) in smaller reserves. We discuss briefly the cost of effective monitoring and the relevance of our results to other regions of Africa and the world.},

abstract = {A dimorphic pattern of macrocephalic (wide, short) and stenocephalic (narrow, long) body shapes is observed in snail-feeding carabid beetles globally. The former exhibits high performance in crushing snail shells with powerful jaws, whereas the latter specializes in eating snails' soft body directly by inserting the head into the shell. In the snail-feeding species Damaster blaptoides, the subspecies D. b. capito has a wide, short forebody, and D. b. fortunei has a narrow, long forebody. They exhibit distinct morphologies despite their geographic and phylogenetic proximity. To examine the genetic basis of the morphological differences between these two subspecies, we conducted quantitative genetic analyses by crossing these subspecies and producing F(1) and backcross hybrids. The hybrids had body shapes intermediate between the parental subspecies. The variation between wide, short and narrow, long forebodies was based on negative genetic correlations between width and length of the head and thorax. Between one and eight genetic factors were involved in the morphological differences between subspecies. We suggest that the morphological integration of forebody parts in a small number of loci has facilitated the marked morphological diversification between subspecies of D. blaptoides.},

A previously experimentally untested prediction is that the amount of transgression increases with the genetic distance between hybridizing species. This follows from QTL studies suggesting that transgression is most commonly due to complementary gene action or epistasis, which become more frequent at larger genetic distances. This is because the number of QTLs fixed for alleles with opposing signs in different species should increase with time since speciation provided that speciation is not driven by disruptive selection. We measured the amount of transgression occurring in hybrids of cichlid fish bred from species pairs with gradually increasing genetic distances and varying phenotypic similarity.

This conflict is thought to be lessened when the symbiont is vertically transmitted, for here transmission depends on the maintenance of a healthy host. Past studies have confirmed this tenet, and have shown vertical transmission to select for decreased virulence. We here investigate the effects of the maternally inherited male-killing Rickettsia symbiont of Adalia bipunctata, the two spot ladybird, on the demography of the female host. Although no effect of infection on larval demography was observed, infection detrimentally affected the adult host, infected females showing both decreased fecundity and longevity in comparison to uninfected controls. These findings are discussed in relation to both the dynamics of the male-killing Rickettsia and the factors which affect the level of virulence of symbionts. Three hypotheses are put forward to explain why inherited symbionts are not avirulent in their female host.},

abstract = {Reticulitermes santonensis is a subterranean termite that invades urban areas in France and elsewhere where it causes damage to human-built structures. We investigated the breeding system, colony and population genetic structure, and mode of dispersal of two French populations of R. santonensis. Termite workers were sampled from 43 and 31 collection points, respectively, from a natural population in west-central France (in and around the island of Oleron) and an urban population (Paris). Ten to 20 workers per collection point were genotyped at nine variable microsatellite loci to determine colony identity and to infer colony breeding structure. There was a total of 26 colonies, some of which were spatially expansive, extending up to 320 linear metres. Altogether, the analysis of genotype distribution, F-statistics and relatedness coefficients suggested that all colonies were extended families headed by numerous neotenics (nonwinged precocious reproductives) probably descended from pairs of primary (winged) reproductives. Isolation by distance among collection points within two large colonies from both populations suggested spatially separated reproductive centres with restricted movement of workers and neotenics. There was a moderate level of genetic differentiation (F(ST) = 0.10) between the Oleron and Paris populations, and the number of alleles was significantly higher in Oleron than in Paris, as expected if the Paris population went through bottlenecks when it was introduced from western France. We hypothesize that the diverse and flexible breeding systems found in subterranean termites pre-adapt them to invade new or marginal habitats. Considering that R. santonensis may be an introduced population of the North American species R. flavipes, a breeding system consisting primarily of extended family colonies containing many neotenic reproductives may facilitate human-mediated spread and establishment of R. santonensis in urban areas with harsh climates.},

abstract = {MAIN CONCLUSION: Switches between pollination syndromes have happened frequently during angiosperm evolution. Using QTL mapping and reciprocal introgressions, we show that changes in reproductive organ morphology have a simple genetic basis. In animal-pollinated plants, flowers have evolved to optimize pollination efficiency by different pollinator guilds and hence reproductive success. The two Petunia species, P. axillaris and P. exserta, display pollination syndromes adapted to moth or hummingbird pollination. For the floral traits color and scent, genetic loci of large phenotypic effect have been well documented. However, such large-effect loci may be typical for shifts in simple biochemical traits, whereas the evolution of morphological traits may involve multiple mutations of small phenotypic effect. Here, we performed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of floral morphology, followed by an in-depth study of pistil and stamen morphology and the introgression of individual QTL into reciprocal parental backgrounds. Two QTLs, on chromosomes II and V, are sufficient to explain the interspecific difference in pistil and stamen length. Since most of the difference in organ length is caused by differences in cell number, genes underlying these QTLs are likely to be involved in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, conservation of the locus on chromosome II in a different P. axillaris subspecies suggests that the evolution of organ elongation was initiated on chromosome II in adaptation to different pollinators. We recently showed that QTLs for pistil and stamen length on chromosome II are tightly linked to QTLs for petal color and volatile emission. Linkage of multiple traits will enable major phenotypic change within a few generations in hybridizing populations. Thus, the genomic architecture of pollination syndromes in Petunia allows for rapid responses to changing pollinator availability.},

Previous tests of the relationship between rates of phenotypic evolution and rates of species diversification have assumed that species richness increases continuously through time. If this assumption is violated, simple phylogenetic estimates of net diversification rate may bear no relationship to processes that influence the distribution of species richness among clades. Here, we demonstrate that the variation in species richness among plethodontid salamander clades is unlikely to have resulted from simple time-dependent processes, leading to fundamentally different conclusions about the relationship between rates of phenotypic evolution and species diversification. Morphological evolutionary rates of both size and shape evolution are correlated with clade species richness, but are uncorrelated with simple estimators of net diversification that assume constancy of rates through time. This coupling between species diversification and phenotypic evolution is consistent with the hypothesis that clades with high rates of morphological trait evolution may diversify more than clades with low rates. Our results indicate that assumptions about underlying processes of diversity regulation have important consequences for interpreting macroevolutionary patterns.},

We call for the development and integrated experimental study of a taxonomic diversity of herbivore model systems and discuss the availability and recent evaluation of suitable taxa. Most importantly, we describe a general comparative framework that can be used to rigorously test a variety of hypotheses about the relative contributions and the macroevolutionary generality of particular mechanisms. Finally, we illustrate important issues for the experimental analysis of speciation ecology by demonstrating the consequences of specialized host associations for ecological divergence and premating isolation in Neochlamisus bebbianae leaf beetles.},

abstract = {Species distribution models should provide conservation practioners with estimates of the spatial distributions of species requiring attention. These species are often rare and have limited known occurrences, posing challenges for creating accurate species distribution models. We tested four modeling methods (Bioclim, Domain, GARP, and Maxent) across 18 species with different levels of ecological specialization using six different sample size treatments and three different evaluation measures. Our assessment revealed that Maxent was the most capable of the four modeling methods in producing useful results with sample sizes as small as 5, 10 and 25 occurrences. The other methods compensated reasonably well (Domain and GARP) to poorly (Bioclim) when presented with datasets of small sample sizes. We show that multiple evaluation measures are necessary to determine accuracy of models produced with presence-only data. Further, we found that accuracy of models is greater for species with small geographic ranges and limited environmental tolerance, ecological characteristics of many rare species. Our results indicate that reasonable models can be made for some rare species, a result that should encourage conservationists to add distribution modeling to their toolbox.},

abstract = {Negative genetic correlations among traits are often used as evidence for tradeoffs that can influence evolutionary trajectories in populations. While there may be evidence for negative correlations within a particular environment, genetic correlations can shift when populations encounter different environmental conditions. Here we review the evidence for these shifts by focusing on experiments that have examined genetic correlations in more than one environment. In many studies, there are significant changes in correlations and these can even switch sign across environments. This raises questions about the validity of deducing genetic constraints from studies in one environment and suggests that the interaction between environmental conditions and the expression of genetic covariation is an important avenue for future work.},

abstract = {Land plants have had the reputation of being problematic for DNA barcoding for two general reasons: (i) the standard DNA regions used in algae, animals and fungi have exceedingly low levels of variability and (ii) the typically used land plant plastid phylogenetic markers (e.g. rbcL, trnL-F, etc.) appear to have too little variation. However, no one has assessed how well current phylogenetic resources might work in the context of identification (versus phylogeny reconstruction). In this paper, we make such an assessment, particularly with two of the markers commonly sequenced in land plant phylogenetic studies, plastid rbcL and internal transcribed spacers of the large subunits of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS), and find that both of these DNA regions perform well even though the data currently available in GenBank/EBI were not produced to be used as barcodes and BLAST searches are not an ideal tool for this purpose. These results bode well for the use of even more variable regions of plastid DNA (such as, for example, psbA-trnH) as barcodes, once they have been widely sequenced. In the short term, efforts to bring land plant barcoding up to the standards being used now in other organisms should make swift progress. There are two categories of DNA barcode users, scientists in fields other than taxonomy and taxonomists. For the former, the use of mitochondrial and plastid DNA, the two most easily assessed genomes, is at least in the short term a useful tool that permits them to get on with their studies, which depend on knowing roughly which species or species groups they are dealing with, but these same DNA regions have important drawbacks for use in taxonomic studies (i.e. studies designed to elucidate species limits). For these purposes, DNA markers from uniparentally (usually maternally) inherited genomes can only provide half of the story required to improve taxonomic standards being used in DNA barcoding. In the long term, we will need to develop more sophisticated barcoding tools, which would be multiple, low-copy nuclear markers with sufficient genetic variability and PCR-reliability; these would permit the detection of hybrids and permit researchers to identify the 'genetic gaps' that are useful in assessing species limits.},

If certain simple criteria are satisfied approximately on an appropriate scale of measurement, nE can be estimated by comparing the phenotypic means and variances in the two parental populations and in their F1 and F2 hybrids (and backcrosses). This generalizes the method of Wright to genetically heterogeneous (or wild) parental populations, as well as inbred lines. Standard errors of the estimates are derived for large samples. The minimum number of genes involved in producing a large difference between populations in a quantitative trait is typically estimated to be about 5 or 10, with occasional values up to 20. This strongly supports the neo-Darwinian theory that large evolutionary changes usually occur by the accumulation of multiple genetic factors with relatively small effects.},

However, a lack of systematic studies leaves many questions open, such as whether cryptic species are more common in particular habitats, latitudes or taxonomic groups.

Divergent natural selection (promoting spatial and food niche partitioning) and sexual selection (assortative mating) have been identi- fied as key selection factors in intralacustric adaptive radiations. However, the evolution of social behaviors accompanying such adaptive radiations is less well under- stood. Using a phylogenetically young species flock of pupfish (Cyprinodon spp.) as a model, we examined differences among six sympatric species and compared their shoaling, aggressive, and territorial behaviors with that of a sister species (C. artifrons). Despite an estimated age of the species flock of less than 8,000 years, pronounced behavioral differentiation was found. C. simus, the smallest species in the flock, shoaled more than the other species and was less aggressive and less territorial than C. beltrani. F1-hybrids between C. simus males and C. beltrani females showed an intermediate expression of shoaling and aggres- sive behavior. Niche partitioning among the members of this species flock appears to be accompanied by rapid divergent evolution of social behaviors. We discuss the potential role of phenotypic plasticity and within-species variation of social behaviors for such rapid behavioral diversifications in sympatric speciation processes.},

abstract = {Reproductive isolation is of fundamental importance for maintaining species boundaries in sympatry. In orchids, the wide variety of pollination systems and highly diverse floral traits have traditionally suggested a prominent role for pollinator isolation, and thus for prezygotic isolation, as an effective barrier to gene flow among species. Here, we examined the nature of reproductive isolation between Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis papilionacea, two sister species of Mediterranean food-deceptive orchids, in two natural hybrid zones. Comparative analyses of the two hybrid zones that are located on soils with volcanic origin and have different and well-dated ages consistently revealed that all hybrid individuals were morphologically and genetically intermediate between the parental species, but had strongly reduced fitness. Molecular analyses based on nuclear ITS1 and (amplified fragment length polymorphism) AFLP markers clearly showed that all examined hybrids were F1 hybrids, and that no introgression occurred between parental species. The maternally inherited plastid DNA markers indicated that hybridization between A. morio and A. papilionacea was bidirectional, as confirmed by the molecular analysis of seed families. The genetic architecture of the two hybrid zones suggests that the two parental species easily and frequently hybridize in sympatry as a consequence of partial pollinator overlap but that strong postzygotic barriers reduce hybrid fitness and prevent gene introgression. These results corroborate that chromosomal divergence is instrumental for reproductive isolation between these food-deceptive orchids and suggest that hybridization is of limited importance for their diversification.},

abstract = {Urbanisation and agriculture dramatically modify the landscapes available for use by wildlife, affecting key aspects of their ecology such as survival, foraging, predation, competition and reproductive success. Relatively little is known about the effects of urbanisation and agriculture on the genetic structure, gene flow and genetic diversity of wild species. Here, landscape genetic techniques were applied to compare local genetic diversity and gene flow between wood mouse populations in urban and arable landscapes. Using nine microsatellite markers, individuals were genotyped from six arable and seven urban sample sites. Inter-population genetic differentiation was significantly greater in urban than arable habitat, while allele richness, private allele richness and heterozygosity were higher for arable sample sites, with varying degrees of significance. These suggest that urban habitat was sufficiently fragmented to limit gene flow. To test the effect of landscape features on gene flow, several cost-distance measures were generated. Overland distance and Euclidean distance correlated best with inter-population genetic differentiation in arable habitat, whereas distances that accommodated differences in habitat quality better explained differentiation in urban habitat. There was no evidence that margins adjacent to roads, rivers or railways facilitated gene flow. Together, the results indicate that urban landscapes expose wood mice to greater fragmentation in habitat quality than arable areas, leading to greater population isolation that is not mitigated by the presence of dispersal corridors.},

A potential problem with these techniques is that environmental correlations between fitness and the traits examined may produce biased estimates of selection gradients. This report demonstrates that the phenotypic covariance between fitness and a trait, used as an estimate of the selection differential in estimating selection gradients, has two components: a component induced by selection itself and a component due to the effect of environmental factors on fitness. The second component is shown to be responsible for biases in estimates of selection gradients. The use of regressions involving genotypic and breeding values instead of phenotypic values can yield estimates of selection gradients that are not biased by environmental covariances. Statistical methods for estimating the coefficients of such regressions, and for testing for biases in regressions involving phenotypic values, are described},

We examined the frequency and distribution of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes in a narrow (5 km) zone of sympatry across an elevational gradient and in putatively uniform diploid and tetraploid reference populations on the Beartooth Pass, in the Rocky Mountains of southern Montana-northern Wyoming. All five reference populations sampled were dominated by a single cytotype, but only one was completely uniform. In the zone of sympatry, 27 transects were sampled every 2 m for a total of 238 plants. Reproductive status (vegetative, flower buds, open flowers) was recorded, and the ploidy of each plant was determined by flow cytometry. Diploid and tetraploid plants predominated (36 and 55{\%}, respectively) but were heterogeneously distributed among the transects. Six of the 27 transects were fixed for a single cytotype (four transects, diploid; two transects, tetraploid), and in seven others either diploids or tetraploids predominated (frequency {\textgreater}75{\%}). Triploids represented 9{\%} of the total sample and occurred most frequently in transects containing both diploids and tetraploids (G = 3.4, df = 2, P = 0.07). Diploids were more often reproductive (in bud, flower, or fruit) than either triploids or tetraploids (G = 12.0, df = 2, P {\textless} 0.001) and were the only cytotype to have produced open flowers. These results suggest that the zone of sympatry is best characterized as a mosaic rather than a cline, with diploid and tetraploids in close proximity and that the distribution of polyploidy is regulated by ecological sorting in a heterogeneous physical environment.},

The generalist/specialist hypothesis predicts that generalist herbivores are more often negatively affected by host plant defenses, wheras specialists may be either unaffected by or attracted to these same "plant defenses". Therefore, specialists should be less predictable than generalists in their responses to induced plant resistance traits. To better understand the variation in plant responses to herbivore attack, and the impacts these responses have on specialist herbivores, we conducted a series of experiments examining pairwise interactinos between two specialaist herbivores of the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). We damaged plants mechnically, with swamp milkweed beetles (Labidomera clivicollis), or with monarchs (Danaus plexippus), and then asessed specificity of elicitation, both by measuring a putative defensive trait (latex volume) and by challenging plants with insects of both species in bioasays. Latex production increased by 34{\%}, and 13{\%} following beetle and monarch herbivory, respectively, but only beetles significantly elevated latex production compared to undamaged controls. While beetle growth was negatively affected by latex across all experiments, beetles were not affected by previous damage caused by conspecifies or by monarchs. In contrast, monarchs feeding on previously damaged plants were 20{\%} smaller, and their response was the same on plants damaged mechnically or by either herbivore. Therefore, these specialist herbivores exhibit both specificity of elicitation in plant responses and specificity of effects in response to prior damage.},

However, the need for active conservation of pollination interactions is only now being ap-preciated. Pollination systems are under increasing threat from anthropogenic sources, including fragmentation of habitat, changes in land use, modern agricul-tural practices, use of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, and invasions of non-native plants and animals. Honeybees, which themselves are non-native pollinators on most continents, and which may harm native bees and other polli-nators, are nonetheless critically important for crop pollination. Recent declines in honeybee numbers in the United States and Europe bring home the importance of healthy pollination systems, and the need to further develop native bees and other animals as crop pollinators. The "pollination crisis" that is evident in de-clines of honeybees and native bees, and in damage to webs of plant-pollinator interaction, may be ameliorated not only by cultivation of a diversity of crop pollinators, but also by changes in habitat use and agricultural practices, species reintroductions and removals, and other means. In addition, ecologists must re-double efforts to study basic aspects of plant-pollinator interactions if optimal management decisions are to be made for conservation of these interactions in natural and agricultural ecosystems.},

However, (i) a generalization of this phenomenon has never been made; and (ii) it is still unclear whether differences in personality traits between rural and urban conspecifics are the result of phenotypic plasticity or of intrinsic differences. In a literature review, we show that behavioural differences between rural and urban conspecifics are common and taxonomically widespread among animals, suggesting a significant ecological impact of urbanization on animal behaviour. In order to gain insight into the mechanisms leading to behavioural differences in urban individuals, we hand-raised and kept European blackbirds (Turdus merula) from a rural and a nearby urban area under common-garden conditions. Using these birds, we investigated individual variation in two behavioural responses to the presence of novel objects: approach to an object in a familiar area (here defined as neophilia), and avoidance of an object in a familiar foraging context (defined as neophobia). Neophilic and neophobic behaviours were mildly correlated and repeatable even across a time period of one year, indicating stable individual behavioural strategies. Blackbirds from the urban population were more neophobic and seasonally less neophilic than blackbirds from the nearby rural area. These intrinsic differences in personality traits are likely the result of microevolutionary changes, although we cannot fully exclude early developmental influences.},

abstract = {Sex differences in the magnitude or direction of mutational effect may be important to a variety of population processes, shaping the mutation load and affecting the cost of sex itself. These differences are expected to be greatest after sexual maturity. Mutation-accumulation (MA) experiments provide the most direct way to examine the consequences of new mutations, but most studies have focused on juvenile viability without regard to sex, and on autosomes rather than sex chromosomes; both adult fitness and X-linkage have been little studied. We therefore investigated the effects of 50 generations of X-chromosome mutation accumulation on the fitness of males and females derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster. Fitness declined rapidly in both sexes as a result of MA, but adult males showed markedly greater fitness loss relative to their controls compared to females expressing identical genotypes, even when females were made homozygous for the X. We estimate that these mutations are partially additive (h {\~{}} 0.3) in females. In addition, the majority of new mutations appear to harm both males and females. Our data helps fill a gap in our understanding of the consequences of sexual selection for genetic load, and suggests that stronger selection on males may indeed purge deleterious mutations affecting female fitness.},

abstract = {Spatial variation in the direction of selection drives the evolution of adaptive differentiation. However, few experimental studies have examined the relative importance of different environmental factors for variation in selection and evolutionary trajectories in natural populations. Here, we combine 8 y of observational data and field experiments to assess the relative importance of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions for spatial variation in selection and short-term evolution of a genetically based floral display dimorphism in the short-lived perennial herb Primula farinosa. Natural populations of this species include two floral morphs: long-scaped plants that present their flowers well above the ground and short-scaped plants with flowers positioned close to the ground. The direction and magnitude of selection on scape morph varied among populations, and so did the frequency of the short morph (median 19{\%}, range 0–100{\%}; n = 69 populations). A field experiment replicated at four sites demonstrated that variation in the strength of interactions with grazers and pollinators were responsible for among-population differences in relative fitness of the two morphs. Selection exerted by grazers favored the short-scaped morph, whereas pollinator-mediated selection favored the long-scaped morph. Moreover, variation in selection among natural populations was associated with differences in morph frequency change, and the experimental removal of grazers at nine sites significantly reduced the frequency of the short-scaped morph over 8 y. The results demonstrate that spatial variation in intensity of grazing and pollination produces a selection mosaic, and that changes in biotic interactions can trigger rapid genetic changes in natural plant populations.},

Since Darwin it has been recognized that the tempo and mode of speciation are greatly influenced by the number and magnitude of genetic changes required for reproductive isolation(2-6), but detailed genetic studies have been limited to a few taxa such as Drosophila(7). Genome mapping techniques now widely adopted in plant(8,9) and animal(10,11) breeding make it possible to investigate the genetic basis of reproductive isolating mechanisms in natural populations. Here we use this approach to map eight floral traits in two sympatric monkeyflower species that are reproductively isolated owing to pollinator preference by bumblebees or hummingbirds. For each trait we found at least one quantitative trait locus accounting for more than 25{\%} of the phenotypic variance. This suggests that genes of large effect can contribute to speciation.},

abstract = {Divergent selection on traits involved in both local adaptation and the production of mating signals can strongly facilitate population differentiation. Because of its links to foraging morphologies and cultural inheritance song of birds can contribute particularly strongly to maintenance of local adaptations. In two adjacent habitats--native Sonoran desert and urban areas--house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) forage on seeds that are highly distinct in size and shell hardness and require different bite forces and bill morphologies. Here, we first document strong and habitat-specific natural selection on bill traits linked to bite force and find adaptive modifications of bite force and bill morphology and associated divergence in courtship song between the two habitats. Second, we investigate the developmental basis of this divergence and find that early ontogenetic tissue transformation in bill, but not skeletal traits, is accelerated in the urban population and that the mandibular primordia of the large-beaked urban finches express bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) earlier and at higher level than those of the desert finches. Further, we show that despite being geographically adjacent, urban and desert populations are nevertheless genetically distinct corroborating findings of early developmental divergence between them. Taken together, these results suggest that divergent selection on function and development of traits involved in production of mating signals, in combination with localized learning of such signals, can be very effective at maintaining local adaptations, even at small spatial scales and in highly mobile animals.},

abstract = {The evolution of an exaggerated trait can lead to a novel morphology that allows organisms to exploit new niches. The molecular bases of such phenotypes can reveal insights into the evolution of unique traits. Here, we investigate a rare morphological innovation in modern haplochromine cichlids, a flap of fibrous tissue that causes a pronounced projection of the snout, which is limited to a single genus (Labeotropheus) of Lake Malawi cichlids. We compare flap size in our focal species L. fuelleborni (LF) to homologous landmarks in other closely related cichlid species that show a range of ecological overlap with LF, and demonstrate that variation in flap size is discontinuous among Malawi cichlid species. We demonstrate further that flap development in LF begins at early juvenile stages, and scales allometrically with body size. We then used an F2 hybrid mapping population, derived via crossing LF to a close ecological competitor that lacks this trait, Tropheops "red cheek" (TRC), to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that underlie flap development. In all, we identified four loci associated with variation in flap size, and for each the LF allele contributed to a larger flap. We next cross-referenced our QTL map with population genomic data, comparing natural populations of LF and TRC, to identify divergent polymorphisms within each QTL interval. Candidate genes for flap development are discussed. Together, these data indicate a relatively simple and tractable genetic basis for this morphological innovation, which is consistent with its apparently sudden and saltatory evolutionary history. J.

Size-assortative reproductive isolation has been linked to recent adaptive radiations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) into freshwater, but the genetic basis of the commonly found size difference between anadromous and derived lacustrine sticklebacks has not been tested. We studied the genetic basis of size differences between recently diverging stickleback lineages in southwest Alaska using a common environment experiment. We crossed stickleback within one anadromous (Naknek River) and one lake (Pringle Lake) population and between the anadromous and two lake populations (Pringle and JoJo Lakes), and raised them in a salinity of 4-6 ppt. The F1 anadromous and freshwater forms differed significantly in size, whereas hybrids were intermediate or exhibited dominance toward the anadromous form. Additionally, the size of freshwater F1s differed from their wild counterparts, with within-population F1s from Pringle Lake growing larger than their wild counterparts, while there was no size difference between lab-raised and wild anadromous fish. Sexual dimorphism was always present in anadromous fish, but not in freshwater, and not always in the hybrid crosses. These results, along with parallel changes among anadromous and freshwater forms in other regions, suggest that this heritable trait is both plastic and may be under divergent and/or sexual selection.},

First, and most important, the number of genic incompatibilities between tax increases much faster than linearly with time. In particular, the probability of speciation increases at least as fast as the square of the time since separation between two taxa. Second, as Muller realized, all hybrid incompatibilities must be initially asymetric. Third, at loci that have diverged between taxa, evolutionarily derived alleles cause hybrid problems far more often than ancestral alleles. Last, it is "easier" to evolve complex hybrid incompatibilites requiring simultaneous action of three or more loci than to evolve simple incompatibilities between pairs of genes. These results have several important implications for genetic analyses of speciation.},

Here, I infer geographic ancestry along genomes of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and the D. melanogaster reference genome, which may have implications for reference alignment, association mapping, and population genomic studies in Drosophila. Overall, the proportion of African ancestry was estimated to be 20{\%} for the DGRP and 9{\%} for the reference genome. Combining my estimate of admixture timing with historical records, I provide the first estimate of natural generation time for this species (approximately 15 generations per year). Ancestry levels were found to vary strikingly across the genome, with less African introgression on the X chromosome, in regions of high recombination, and at genes involved in specific processes (e.g., circadian rhythm). An important role for natural selection during the admixture process was further supported by evidence that many unlinked pairs of loci showed a deficiency of Africa-Europe allele combinations between them. Numerous epistatic fitness interactions may therefore exist between African and European genotypes, leading to ongoing selection against incompatible variants. By focusing on hubs in this network of fitness interactions, I identified a set of interacting loci that include genes with roles in sensation and neuropeptide/hormone reception. These findings suggest that admixed D. melanogaster samples could become an important study system for the genetics of early-stage isolation between populations.},

We used the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and its host-specific parasitic flatworm Gyrodactylus gasterostei of the Belgian lowland-upland system to test for local adaptation and assess whether findings are consistent over different life stages. Question: Is the Gasterosteus-Gyrodactylus host-parasite model system an example of local adaptation? Hypothesis: Parasites have higher infection success on sympatric than on allopatric host populations. Methods: F1 laboratory-bred stickleback originating from a lowland and upland population were infected with parasites of lowland and upland origin. We monitored parasite numbers per individual for 6 weeks and for two life stages and calculated the effect size of local adaptation. Results: Infection success of parasites was not higher on sympatric than on allopatric host populations. Instead, total worm load differed among sub-adult host populations, but not among adult host populations. This suggests immune competence differs among host populations at a specific life stage, rather than local adaptation of the parasite.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because arctic plant communities are highly vulnerable to climate change, shifts in their composition require rapid, accurate identifications, often for specimens that lack diagnostic floral characters. The present study examines the role that DNA barcoding can play in aiding floristic evaluations in the arctic by testing the effectiveness of the core plant barcode regions (rbcL, matK) and a supplemental ribosomal DNA (ITS2) marker for a well-studied flora near Churchill, Manitoba. RESULTS: This investigation examined 900 specimens representing 312 of the 354 species of vascular plants known from Churchill. Sequencing success was high for rbcL: 95{\%} for fresh specimens and 85{\%} for herbarium samples (mean age 20 years). ITS2 worked equally well for the fresh and herbarium material (89{\%} and 88{\%}). However, sequencing success was lower for matK, despite two rounds of PCR amplification, which reflected less effective primer binding and sensitivity to the DNA degradation (76{\%} of fresh, 45{\%} of herbaria samples). A species was considered as taxonomically resolved if its members showed at least one diagnostic difference from any other taxon in the study and formed a monophyletic clade. The highest species resolution (69{\%}) was obtained by combining information from all three genes. The joint sequence information for rbcL and matK distinguished 54{\%} of 286 species, while rbcL and ITS2 distinguished 63{\%} of 285 species. Discrimination of species within Salix, which constituted 8{\%} of the flora, was particularly problematic. Despite incomplete resolution, the barcode results revealed 22 misidentified herbarium specimens, and enabled the identification of field specimens which were otherwise too immature to identify. Although seven cases of ITS2 paralogy were noted in the families Cyperaceae, Juncaceae and Juncaginaceae, this intergenic spacer played an important role in resolving congeneric plant species at Churchill. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided fast and cost-effective solution to create a comprehensive, effective DNA barcode reference library for a local flora.},

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins.

abstract = {Aims Adaptive evolution of invasive species is both particularly exciting for the evolutionary biologist and worrisome for those interested in controlling or halting spread. Invasive species often have a dis-tinct timeline and well-recorded population expansion. As invaders encounter new environments, they undergo rapid adaptive evolu-tion. Our aim in this study was to measure variation of floral size in the invasive shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) and measure natural selection by pollinators on that trait. Past research has found that this invasive plant is pollinator limited in Washington State and that declines in pollinator populations can contribute to local extinction in another invaded range (New Zealand). This plant is pollinated by both native and introduced species of bees, represent-ing a broad range of pollinator sizes. Cytisus scoparius has a flower structure that is highly conducive to studies on pollinator choice, even in the absence of direct pollinator observations. Methods We surveyed urban and rural sites in and around the city of Olympia in Washington State. Measuring banner width, we were able to show that flower size varies substantially between plants but mini-mally within plants. By measuring the proportion of flowers that were 'tripped', we could determine pollinator visitation rates and thus determine the level of selection due to pollinator choice alone. Important Findings We found that C. scoparius is under natural selection by pollinators for increased flower size. However, such positive natural selection was only seen in urban populations although it was consistent across two flowering seasons. Rural populations of Scotch broom do not appear to be under selection on flower size. The natural selection by pollinators on broom flowers could result in adaptive evolution into a new pollination niche by an invading species. A higher level of variation in broom flowers seen here than seen in previous works in native regions suggests that C. scoparius may be highly diverse and primed for adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {Fisher's geometric model has been widely used to study the effects of pleiotropy and organismic complexity on phenotypic adaptation. Here, we study a version of Fisher's model in which a population adapts to a gradually moving optimum. Key parameters are the rate of environmental change, the dimensionality of phenotype space, and the patterns of mutational and selectional correlations. We focus on the distribution of adaptive substitutions, that is, the multivariate distribution of the phenotypic effects of fixed beneficial mutations. Our main results are based on an "adaptive-walk approximation," which is checked against individual-based simulations. We find that (1) the distribution of adaptive substitutions is strongly affected by the ecological dynamics and largely depends on a single composite parameter $\gamma$, which scales the rate of environmental change by the "adaptive potential" of the population; (2) the distribution of adaptive substitution reflects the shape of the fitness landscape if the environment changes slowly, whereas it mirrors the distribution of new mutations if the environment changes fast; (3) in contrast to classical models of adaptation assuming a constant optimum, with a moving optimum, more complex organisms evolve via larger adaptive steps.},

abstract = {Recently, some evolutionary biologists have argued that selection on the male component of fitness shapes the evolution of reproductive characters in angiosperms. Floral features, such as inflorescence size, that lead to increased insect visitation without a concomitant increase in seed production are viewed as adaptations to enhance the probability of fathering seeds on other plants. In tests of this "pollen donation hypothesis," male reproductive success has usually been measured indirectly by flower production, pollinator visitation, or pollen removal. We tested the pollen donation hypothesis directly by quantifying the number of seeds sired by individual genotypes in a natural population of poke milkweed, Asclepias exaltata , in southwestern Virginia. Multiple paternity was low within fruits, a fact which allowed us to use genotypes of progeny arrays to identify a unique pollen parent for 85{\%} of the fruits produced in the population. Seeds sired (male success) and seeds produced (female success) were significantly correlated with flower number per plant (for male success, r = 0.32, P {\textless} 0.05; for female success, r = 0.66, P {\textless} 0.001).},

abstract = {Most species are superbly and intricately adapted to the environments in which they live. Adaptive evolution by natural selection is the primary force shaping biological diversity. Differences between closely related species in ecologically selected characters such as habitat preference, reproductive timing, courtship behavior, or pollinator attraction may prevent interbreeding in nature, causing reproductive isolation. But does ecological adaptation cause reproductive incompatibilities such as hybrid sterility or lethality? Although several genes causing hybrid incompatibilities have been identified, there is intense debate over whether the genes that contribute to ecological adaptations also cause hybrid incompatibilities. Thirty years ago, a genetic study of local adaptation to copper mine soils in the wildflower Mimulus guttatus identified a locus that appeared to cause copper tolerance and hybrid lethality in crosses to other populations. But do copper tolerance and hybrid lethality have the same molecular genetic basis? Here we show, using high-resolution genome mapping, that copper tolerance and hybrid lethality are not caused by the same gene but are in fact separately controlled by two tightly linked loci. We further show that selection on the copper tolerance locus indirectly caused the hybrid incompatibility allele to go to high frequency in the copper mine population because of hitchhiking. Our results provide a new twist on Darwin's original supposition that hybrid incompatibilities evolve as an incidental by-product of ordinary adaptation to the environment.},

abstract = {The body size of a univoltine carabid beetle Carabus tosanus on Shikoku Island, Japan, was clearly smaller in higher-altitude populations (subspecies), which possibly represents incipient speciation. To explore the determinants of altitudinal differences in body size in this species, we studied the degree of phenotypic plasticity by conducting rearing experiments at two constant temperatures and examined genetic differences through interpopulation crosses. At 15 °C, C. tosanus had a longer developmental period and a shorter adult body than at 20 °C. Nevertheless, variation in body size due to temperature effects (phenotypic plasticity) was small compared to the interpopulation differences, which suggests substantial genetic differences between populations (subspecies) at different altitudes. In F(1) offspring from crosses between a low-altitude (subspecies tosanus) and a high-altitude population (subspecies ishizuchianus), adult body length was affected by the genotypes of both parents, with an interaction effect of parental genotype and offspring sex. Further analyses revealed that adult body length was affected by sex-linked factors in addition to autosomal factors. These genetic differences in body size may have resulted from adaptations to different altitudes and may be important for the process of incipient speciation because body size differences could contribute to premating reproductive isolation.},

abstract = {A problem involving the relationships between chromosome number and the degree of winter hardiness in the higher plants is outlined. A scale of relative degree of winter hardiness was constructed in order to compare the resistance to cold of related species belonging to families ranging from the temperate zone to the tropics. The data so far obtained have been arranged in an extensive table, and show the author's chromosome number determinations of 100 species and varieties of angiosperms, with a comparison of counts already reported in related species. In most cases the differences in the degree of winter hardiness of related species are not correlated with chromosome number differences. A wide range of variation in degree of winter hardiness was found within the diploid species of many genera, and several hardy species which are the northernmost representatives of tropical families proved to be diploids. In numerous cases, the same chromosome number was found in hardy and non-hardy species of closely related genera belonging to tropical families. Tetraploid species are either hardier, less hardy, or of the same degree of hardiness as compared with related diploid species. The whole range of hardiness has been demonstrated within the tetraploid species of a genus. In other genera striking differences in the degree of hardiness were found within both diploid and tetraploid groups of species. These data indicate that, in nature, genic mutation and inter- and intra-specific hybridization have been more important processes than chromosome doubling. The data do not support the theory that polyploids are usually hardier than diploids and are therefore better adapted to climatically unfavorable regions.},

abstract = {There is currently international interest in the application of DNA barcoding as a tool for plant species discrimination and identification. In this study, we evaluated the utility of five candidate plant DNA barcoding regions [rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL-F and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)] in Eurasian yews. This group of species is taxonomically difficult because of a lack of clear-cut morphologically differences between species and hence represents a good test case for DNA barcoding. Forty-seven accessions were analysed, representing all taxa treated in current floristic works and covering most of the distribution range of Taxus in Eurasia. As single loci, trnL-F and ITS showed the highest species discriminatory power, each resolving 11 of 11 lineages (= barcode taxa). Species discrimination using matK, trnH-psbA and rbcL individually was lower, with matK resolving 8 of 10, trnH-psbA 7 of 11 and rbcL 5 of 11 successfully sequenced lineages. The proposed CBOL core barcode (rbcL + matK) resolved 8 of 11 lineages. Combining loci generally increased the robustness (measured by clade support) of the barcoding discrimination. Based on overall performance, trnL-F and ITS, separately or combined, are proposed as barcode for Eurasian Taxus. DNA barcoding discriminated recognized taxa of Eurasian Taxus, namely T. baccata, T. cuspidata, T. fuana and T. sumatrana, and identified seven lineages among the T. wallichiana group, some with distinct geographical distributions and morphologies, and potentially representing new species. Using the proposed DNA barcode, a technical system can be established to rapidly and reliably identify Taxus species in Eurasia for conservation protection and for monitoring illegal trade.},

abstract = {As the basal resource in most food webs, plants have evolved myriad strategies to battle consumption by herbivores. Over the past 50 years, plant defense theories have been formulated to explain the remarkable variation in abundance, distribution, and diversity of secondary chemistry and other defensive traits. For example, classic theories of enemy-driven evolutionary dynamics have hypothesized that defensive traits escalate through the diversification process. Despite the fact that macroevolutionary patterns are an explicit part of defense theories, phylogenetic analyses have not been previously attempted to disentangle specific predictions concerning (i) investment in resistance traits, (ii) recovery after damage, and (iii) plant growth rate. We constructed a molecular phylogeny of 38 species of milkweed and tested four major predictions of defense theory using maximum-likelihood methods. We did not find support for the growth-rate hypothesis. Our key finding was a pattern of phyletic decline in the three most potent resistance traits (cardenolides, latex, and trichomes) and an escalation of regrowth ability. Our neontological approach complements more common paleontological approaches to discover directional trends in the evolution of life and points to the importance of natural enemies in the macroevolution of species. The finding of macroevolutionary escalating regowth ability and declining resistance provides a window into the ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between plants and herbivores and suggests a revision of classic plant defense theory. Where plants are primarily consumed by specialist herbivores, regrowth (or tolerance) may be favored over resistance traits during the diversification process.},

Developmental stability assessed by the level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA), and canalization by the within- and among-individual variance, were measured on several floral traits of Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae). Hybridization affected canalization. Both within- and among-individual phenotypic variance decreased in hybrids from populations of intermediate genetic distance, and strongly increased in hybrids from genetically distant populations. Mean-trait FA differed among cross-types, but hybrids were not consistently more or less asymmetric than parental lines across traits. We found no congruence between changes in FA and changes in phenotypic variance. These results suggest that developmental stability (measured by FA) and canalization are independently controlled. This study also confirms the weak relationship between FA and the breakdown of coadapted gene complexes following inter-population hybridization.},

During the past two decades we observed an exponential growth of publications on cryptic species. Recently published reviews have demonstrated cryptic species have profound consequences on many biological disciplines. It has been proposed that their distribution is non-random across taxa and biomes. RESULTS: We analysed a literature database for the taxonomic and biogeographical distribution of cryptic animal species reports. Results from regression analysis indicate that cryptic species are almost evenly distributed among major metazoan taxa and biogeographical regions when corrected for species richness and study intensity. CONCLUSION: This indicates that morphological stasis represents an evolutionary constant and that cryptic metazoan diversity does predictably affect estimates of earth's animal diversity. Our findings have direct theoretical and practical consequences for a number of prevailing biological questions with regard to global biodiversity estimates, conservation efforts and global taxonomic initiatives.},

We discuss statistical and biological issues that may arise in applications of Lande and Arnold's (1983) multiple-regression approach to measuring selection. We review as- sumptions involved in estimation and hypothesis testing in regression problems, and we note difficulties that frequently arise as a result of violation of these assumptions. In particular, mul- ticollinearity (extreme intercorrelation of characters) and extrinsic, unmeasured factors affecting fitness may seriously complicate inference regarding selection. Further, violation of the assumption that residuals are normally distributed vitiates tests of significance. For this situation, we suggest applications of recently developed jackknife tests of significance. While fitness regression permits direct assessment of selection in a form suitable for predicting selection response, we suggest that the aim of inferring causal relationships about the effects of phenotypic characters on fitness is greatly facilitated by manipulative experiments. Finally, we discuss alternative definitions of sta- bilizing and disruptive selection},

abstract = {We introduce the concept of many-to-one mapping of form to function and suggest that this emergent property of complex systems promotes the evolution of physiological diversity. Our work has focused on a 4-bar linkage found in labrid fish jaws that transmits muscular force and motion from the lower jaw to skeletal elements in the upper jaws. Many different 4-bar shapes produce the same amount of output rotation in the upper jaw per degree of lower jaw rotation, a mechanical property termed Maxillary KT. We illustrate three consequences of many-to-one mapping of 4-bar shape to Maxillary KT. First, many-to-one mapping can partially decouple morphological and mechanical diversity within clades. We found with simulations of 4-bars evolving on phylogenies of 500 taxa that morphological and mechanical diversity were only loosely correlated (R(2) = 0.25). Second, redundant mapping permits the simultaneous optimization of more than one mechanical property of the 4-bar. Labrid fishes have capitalized on this flexibility, as illustrated by several species that have Maxillary KT = 0.8 but have different values of a second property, Nasal KT. Finally, many-to-one mapping may increase the influence of historical factors in determining the evolution of morphology. Using a genetic model of 4-bar evolution we exerted convergent selection on three different starting 4-bar shapes and found that mechanical convergence only created morphological convergence in simulations where the starting forms were similar. Many-to-one mapping is widespread in physiological systems and operates at levels ranging from the redundant mapping of genotypes to phenotypes, up to the morphological basis of whole-organism performance. This phenomenon may be involved in the uneven distribution of functional diversity seen among animal lineages.},

Increased competitive ability may be advantageous for survival in dense vegetation and may strongly affect local and regional abundances of cytotypes and potentially contribute to invasion success. We compared survival, growth and reproduction of plants originating from bulbils of three cytotypes (2n = 4x, 5x, 6x) of Allium oleraceum growing with and without a competitor (Arrhenatherum elatius). There was a strong negative effect of competition but no effect of ploidy or ploidy × competition on survivorship, height and total dry mass of A. oleraceum, i.e. no support for different competitive abilities of the ploidy levels. However, slightly different responses of populations to competition treatments within all cytotypes suggest differentiation within cytotypes. Under competition, plant survivorship was low, surviving plants were small, had low dry mass and produced neither sexual nor asexual propagules. Without competition, plant survivorship was high, and cytotypes differed in three traits after 2 year's growth: dry mass of flowers, number of flowers and ratio of the dry mass of sexual to asexual propagules all decreased with increasing ploidy level. We additionally tested tetra- and pentaploids as to whether plants originating from different types of propagule (bulbils, seeds) differ in survivorship, growth and reproduction when growing with and without a competitor. Plants originating from bulbils had higher survivorship, were more robust, flowered earlier and produced more propagules when compared to plants originating from seeds and grown without competition. Under competition, differences in performance between plants originating from seeds and bulbils mostly disappeared, with higher survivorship only for plants originating from bulbils.},

abstract = {Local adaptation, adaptive population divergence and speciation are often expected to result from populations evolving in response to spatial variation in selection. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the major features that characterise the spatial patterns of selection, namely the extent of variation among populations in the strength and direction of selection. Here, we analyse a data set of spatially replicated studies of directional phenotypic selection from natural populations. The data set includes 60 studies, consisting of 3937 estimates of selection across an average of five populations. We performed meta-analyses to explore features characterising spatial variation in directional selection. We found that selection tends to vary mainly in strength and less in direction among populations. Although differences in the direction of selection occur among populations they do so where selection is often weakest, which may limit the potential for ongoing adaptive population divergence. Overall, we also found that spatial variation in selection appears comparable to temporal (annual) variation in selection within populations; however, several deficiencies in available data currently complicate this comparison. We discuss future research needs to further advance our understanding of spatial variation in selection.},

Ecologists have been criticized for treating the city as homoge- neous and urbanization as one-dimensional. To develop ecological understanding of integrated human–natural systems, the fine-scale heterogeneity of their built and natural components must be quantified. There have been calls for the integration of the biophysical and human components of systems, but here we provide a new tool to quantify this integrated heterogeneity by reconceptualizing urban land-use and land-cover classification approaches. This new tool, High Ecological Resolution Classification for Urban Landscapes and Environmental Systems (HERCULES), balances detail and efficiency and is flexible, allowing it to be used for interdisciplinary research, with ancillary datasets, and across urban systems.},

abstract = {Different kinds of plant-animal interactions are ordinarily studied in isolation, yet considering the combined fitness effects of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions is essential to understanding plant character evolution. Functional, structural, or phylogenetic associations between attractive and defensive traits may be nonadaptive or result from correlational selection on sets of herbivory- and pollination-linked traits. Nonadditivity of fitness effects of mutualists and antagonists, a requisite for correlational selection, was experimentally tested in the field. We created experimental populations of the insect-pollinated perennial herb, Helleborus foetidus, at 16 different locations distributed among three regions in the Iberian Peninsula. Plants experienced one of four possible selective regimes generated by independently weakening the effects of pollinators and herbivores (flower and fruit predators) according to a two-way fully factorial design. Effects were assessed in terms of number of next-generation offspring recruited per mother plant under natural field conditions. Differences among H. foetidus plants in the strength of their interactions with pollinators and herbivores translated into differential fitness, as measured in terms of recruited offspring, and subsequent changes in plant population densities. A strong, geographically consistent nonadditivity in the fitness consequences of pollinators and herbivores was found also. Plants possessing the particular combination of "traits" simultaneously enhancing pollination and escape from herbivores enjoyed a disproportionate fitness advantage over plants possessing any of the other three possible "trait" combinations. Results suggest a simple, possibly widespread ecological pathway favoring the adaptive correlated evolution of mutualism- and antagonism-related plant traits in pollinator-dependent plants suffering intense flower and fruit herbivory.},

abstract = {Vegetation surveys are conducted to obtain a catalogue of the plant species that occupy an area of interest, and are used to inform the decisions of policymakers about conservation, development, and remediation efforts. Currently, vegetation surveys rely on traditional morphology-based taxonomic practices to identify collected specimens. By implementing recent advances in molecular taxonomy, it may be possible to improve upon these methods and reduce the associated costs. In this study, we used both morphological and molecular taxonomic methods to sample 337 forest vegetation plots in northeastern Ontario, Canada. DNA barcoding-a molecular taxonomic tool-was used to identify specimens collected in the molecular taxonomic survey. The molecular taxonomic survey identified a mean of 12.4 species per plot and 202 species in total, whereas the morphological taxonomic survey identified a mean of 9.8 species per plot and 142 species in total; both surveys provided identical estimates of community similarity. The morphological taxonomic survey was 37 {\%} more expensive than molecular taxonomic survey, owing largely to the increased time required in the field to collect specimens that flowered at different times. Our results indicate that molecular taxonomic tools are more cost-effective than traditional morphology-based taxonomic practices for species identification in vegetation surveys. Taxonomy underpins all conservation, and the implementation of molecular taxonomic tools for vegetation surveys has promise to lessen the consequences of the taxonomic impediment and increase the effectiveness of conservation efforts.},

abstract = {There are now thousands of estimates of phenotypic selection in natural populations, resulting in multiple synthetic reviews of these data. Here we consider several major lessons and limitations emerging from these syntheses, and how they may guide future studies of selection in the wild. First, we review past analyses of the patterns of directional selection. We present new meta-analyses that confirm differences in the direction and magnitude of selection for different types of traits and fitness components. Second, we describe patterns of temporal and spatial variation in directional selection, and their implications for cumulative selection and directional evolution. Meta-analyses suggest that sampling error contributes importantly to observed temporal variation in selection, and indicate that evidence for frequent temporal changes in the direction of selection in natural populations is limited. Third, we review the apparent lack of evidence for widespread stabilizing selection, and discuss biological and methodological explanations for this pattern. Finally, we describe how sampling error, statistical biases, choice of traits, fitness measures and selection metrics, environmental covariance and other factors may limit the inferences we can draw from analyses of selection coefficients. Current standardized selection metrics based on simple parametric statistical models may be inadequate for understanding patterns of non-linear selection and complex fitness surfaces. We highlight three promising areas for expanding our understanding of selection in the wild: (1) field studies of stabilizing selection, selection on physiological and behavioral traits, and the ecological causes of selection; (2) new statistical models and methods that connect phenotypic variation to population demography and selection; and (3) availability of the underlying individual-level data sets from past and future selection studies, which will allow comprehensive modeling of selection and fitness variation within and across systems, rather than meta-analyses of standardized selection metrics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Second, phenotypic plasticity alters the distribution of phenotypes, thereby placing populations in new selective regimes. A small isolated population of dark-eyed juncos Junco hyemalis became established in San Diego, probably in the early 1980s and probably from the nearby mountains. The relatively mild coastal climate has resulted in an increase in both the mean and the variance of the length of time females breed each year, and this is assumed to be a result of phenotypic plasticity. The population has evolved reduced white in the tail. We studied contemporary patterns of selection on tail white, in the context of the altered breeding season length. Late-hatched nestlings had higher survival and were in better condition than early-hatched nestlings, but among survivors, late-hatched birds had less tail white. We suggest this reflects juvenile mortality favoring individuals with less tail white. In adults, we found weak sexual selection and no viability selection but positive selection on female tail white in association with fecundity. We argue that altered breeding season length had a major impact on patterns of selection and evolution in this population.},

abstract = {The extent and nature of genetic incompatibilities between incipient races and sibling species is of fundamental importance to our view of speciation. However, with the exception of hybrid inviability and sterility factors, little is known about the extent of other, more subtle genetic incompatibilities between incipient species. Here we experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of such genetic incompatibilities between two young allopatric sibling species, Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia. Our experiments took advantage of 12 introgression lines that carried random introgressed D. sechellia segments in different parts of the D. simulans genome. First, we found that these introgression lines did not show any measurable sterility or inviability effects. To study if these sechellia introgressions in a simulans background contained other fitness consequences, we competed and genetically tracked the marked alleles within each introgression against the wild-type alleles for 20 generations. Strikingly, all marked D. sechellia introgression alleles rapidly decreased in frequency in only 6 to 7 generations. We then developed computer simulations to model our competition results. These simulations indicated that selection against D. sechellia introgression alleles was high (average s = 0.43) and that the marker alleles and the incompatible alleles did not separate in 78{\%} of the introgressions. The latter result likely implies that most introgressions contain multiple genetic incompatibilities. Thus, this study reveals that, even at early stages of speciation, many parts of the genome diverge to a point where introducing foreign elements has detrimental fitness consequences, but which cannot be seen using standard sterility and inviability assays.},

abstract = {In cities with intense low-frequency traffic noise, birds have been observed to sing louder and at a higher pitch. Several studies argue that higher song pitch is an adaptation to reduce masking from noise, and it has even been suggested that the song divergence between urban and nonurban songs might lead to reproductive isolation. Here we present models of signal transmission to compare the benefits of raised song amplitude and song pitch in terms of sound transmission. We chose two bird species that sing with higher pitch in urban areas, the great tit (Parus major) and the blackbird (Turdus merula). For both species, we calculated communication distances in response to different levels of urban noise and in their natural forest habitats. We found that an increase in vocal pitch increased communication distance only marginally. In contrast, vocal amplitude adjustments had a strong and significantly larger effect. Our results indicate that frequency changes of urban songs are not very effective in mitigating masking from traffic noise. Increased song pitch might not be an adaptation to reduce signal masking but a physiological side effect of singing at high amplitudes or an epiphenomenon of urbanization that is not related to signal transmission.},

abstract = {The distribution of C-14-assimilate from single leaves on the main stolon and branch stolons was investigated at different stages of plant development in a small-leaved wild genotype of Trifolium repens. A widespread distribution pattern was observed with assimilate moving from source leaves to all plant parts, with the closest sinks receiving the greatest proportion of assimilate. A high proportion of assimilate was translocated to the branch stolon originating at the same node as the C-14-treated leaf, thus indicating a close vascular linkage between source and sink. Branch stolons were shown to import and export simultaneously large quantities of assimilate at all stages of development investigated. Overall the pattern of assimilate distribution on the main stolon and from equivalent positioned leaves on a basally positioned branch stolon was very similar at all stages of plant development. The high degree of clonal integration and reciprocal assimilate exchange in T. repens are discussed in relation to growth in pastures.},

Development was divided into nine stages (A-I). Many of the hybrids' traits were identical and intermediate to those of their parents. The position of the eye, however, was primarily sinistral in both hybrids (80{\%} in Sb and 76{\%} in Bs), a trait possessed by P. stellatus (80{\%}) in the western Pacific Ocean. The daily growth rates of the larvae were similar. In the parent species, development was more rapid in P. stellatus than in K. bicoloratus whereas rate of development was intermediate in both Sb and Bs hybrids.

We sequenced liver mRNA transcripts from multiple individuals collected from urban populations in New York City and rural populations in undisturbed protected areas nearby and assembled a reference transcriptome using 1 080 065 954 SOLiD 5500XL (75 bp) reads and 3 052 640 454 GS FLX + reads. The reference contained 40 908 contigs with a N50 = 1044 bp and a total content of 30.06 Megabases (Mb). Contigs were annotated from Mus musculus (39.96{\%} annotated) Uniprot databases. We identified 104 655 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 65 single sequence repeats (SSRs) with flanking primers. We also used normalized read counts to identify putative gene expression differences in 10 genes between populations. There were 19 contigs significantly differentially expressed in urban populations compared to rural populations, with gene function annotations generally related to the translation and modification of proteins and those involved in immune responses. The individual transcriptomes generated in this study will be used to investigate evolutionary responses to urbanization. The reference transcriptome provides a valuable resource for the scientific community using North American Peromyscus species as emerging model systems for ecological genetics and adaptation.},

Destructive harvesting practices threaten the existence of some plant species. Harvesters of medicinal roots identify the collected species according to their own folk taxonomies, but once the dried or powdered roots enter the chain of commercialization, accurate identification becomes more challenging.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: A survey of morphological diversity among four root products traded in the medina of Marrakech was conducted. Fifty-one root samples were selected for molecular identification using DNA barcoding using three markers, trnH-psbA, rpoC1, and ITS. Sequences were searched using BLAST against a tailored reference database of Moroccan medicinal plants and their closest relatives submitted to NCBI GenBank.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Combining psbA-trnH, rpoC1, and ITS allowed the majority of the market samples to be identified to species level. Few of the species level barcoding identifications matched the scientific names given in the literature, including the most authoritative and widely cited pharmacopeia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The four root complexes selected from the medicinal plant products traded in Marrakech all comprise more than one species, but not those previously asserted. The findings have major implications for the monitoring of trade in endangered plant species as morphology-based species identifications alone may not be accurate. As a result, trade in certain species may be overestimated, whereas the commercialization of other species may not be recorded at all.},

abstract = {Catfish is the leading aquaculture species in the United States. The interspecific hybrid catfish produced by mating female channel catfish with male blue catfish outperform both of their parent species in a number of traits. However, mass production of the hybrids has been difficult because of reproductive isolation. Investigations of genome structure and organization of the hybrids provide insights into the genetic basis for maintenance of species divergence in the face of gene flow, thereby helping develop strategies for introgression and efficient production of the hybrids for aquaculture. In this study, we constructed a high-density genetic linkage map using the hybrid catfish system with the catfish 250K SNP array. A total of 26,238 SNPs were mapped to 29 linkage groups, with 12,776 unique marker positions. The linkage map spans approximately 3240 cM with an average intermarker distance of 0.25 cM. A fraction of markers (986 of 12,776) exhibited significant deviation from the expected Mendelian ratio of segregation, and they were clustered in major genomic blocks across 15 LGs, most notably LG9 and LG15. The distorted markers exhibited significant bias for maternal alleles among the backcross progenies, suggesting strong selection against the blue catfish alleles. The clustering of distorted markers within genomic blocks should lend insights into speciation as marked by incompatibilities between the two species. Such findings should also have profound implications for understanding the genomic evolution of closely related species as well as the introgression of hybrid production programs in aquaculture.},

We sampled four populations located on a mountain in the heart of Montreal (Quebec, Canada), which presents a mosaic of forested patches isolated by roads, graveyards and buildings. We assessed the genetic structure of these populations using microsatellite loci and compared it to the genetic structure of four populations located in a continuous habitat in southern Quebec. Our results indicate that allelic richness and heterozygosity are lower in the urban populations. Exact differentiation tests and pairwise F-ST also show that the populations found in the fragmented habitat are genetically differentiated, whereas populations located in the continuous habitat are genetically homogeneous. These results raise conservation concerns for these populations as well as for rare or threatened species inhabiting urban landscapes.},

abstract = {Phenotypic divergence can promote reproductive isolation and speciation, suggesting a possible link between rates of phenotypic evolution and the tempo of speciation at multiple evolutionary scales. To date, most macroevolutionary studies of diversification have focused on morphological traits, whereas behavioral traits─including vocal signals─are rarely considered. Thus, although behavioral traits often mediate mate choice and gene flow, we have a limited understanding of how behavioral evolution contributes to diversification. Furthermore, the developmental mode by which behavioral traits are acquired may affect rates of behavioral evolution, although this hypothesis is seldom tested in a phylogenetic framework. Here, we examine evidence for rate shifts in vocal evolution and speciation across two major radiations of codistributed passerines: one oscine clade with learned songs (Thraupidae) and one suboscine clade with innate songs (Furnariidae). We find that evolutionary bursts in rates of speciation and song evolution are coincident in both thraupids and furnariids. Further, overall rates of vocal evolution are higher among taxa with learned rather than innate songs. Taken together, these findings suggest an association between macroevolutionary bursts in speciation and vocal evolution, and that the tempo of behavioral evolution can be influenced by variation in developmental modes among lineages},

abstract = {Geographical areas where two species come into contact and hybridize serve as natural laboratories for assessing mechanisms that limit gene flow between species. The ranges of about half of all closely related Drosophila species overlap, and the genomes of several pairs reveal signatures of past introgression. However, only two contemporary hybrid zones have been characterized in the genus, and both are recently diverged sister species ( D. simulans-D. sechellia , Ks = 0.05; D. yakuba-D. santomea , Ks = 0.048). Here we present evidence of a new hybrid zone, and the ecological mechanisms that maintain it, between two highly divergent Drosophila species (Ks = 0.11). On the island of Bioko in west Africa, D. teissieri occupies mostly forests, D. yakuba occupies mostly open agricultural areas, and recently, we discovered that hybrids between these species occur near the interface of these habitats. Genome sequencing revealed that all field-sampled hybrids are F1 progeny of D. yakuba females and D. teissieri males. We found no evidence for either advanced-generation hybrids or F1 hybrids produced by D. teissieri females and D. yakuba males. The lack of advanced-generation hybrids on Bioko is consistent with mark-recapture and laboratory experiments that we conducted, which indicate hybrids have a maladaptive combination of traits. Like D. yakuba , hybrids behaviorally prefer open habitat that is relatively warm and dry, but like D. teissieri , hybrids have low desiccation tolerance, which we predict leaves them physiologically ill-equipped to cope with their preferred habitat. These observations are consistent with recent findings of limited introgression in the D. yakuba clade and identify an ecological mechanism for limiting gene flow between D. yakuba and D. teissieri ; namely, selection against hybrids that we have documented, in combination with hybrid male sterility, contributes to the maintenance of this narrow ({\~{}}30m), stable hybrid zone centered on the forest-open habitat ecotone. Our results show how a deleterious combination of parental traits can result in unfit or maladapted hybrids.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have successfully used topographic variables for the prediction of plant species distributions in mountainous areas. A current question is which scale optimizes the predictive power of these variables. Due to the development of airborne radar/laser scanning, very high resolution digital elevation models (VHR DEMs) with a typical resolution of 1 m have emerged, allowing an accurate estimation of surface derivatives on a fine scale. Improved understanding of the relationship between scale and predictive power, through a comparative assessment of the significance of topographic variables computed at different scales, is needed. It should help researchers in selecting an adequate scale for the computation of topographic factors and further also increase the precision of models for predicting plant species distributions, and find direct applications, such as a better estimation of potential refuges for plant species in a climate change scenario. In this context, it is worth exploring the use of VHR DEM's techniques for data acquisition. In this study, we use a 1 m resolution laser DEM and a standard 25 m resolution DEM to compute four terrain variables (slope, aspect, plan curvature and profile curvature) at six different scales and compare their predictive ability. Univariate logistic regression models are fitted to presence/absence data of 117 alpine plant species collected at 125 sites in the Western Alps of Switzerland. The results show that slope and aspect, through northness = cos(aspect), are strongly correlated to the presence/absence data of many surveyed species. Using a laser VHR DEM significantly improves the predictive ability of aspect. The predictive power of slope and aspect is optimized when these variables are derived using a calculation window of about 100 m × 100 m (slope) and 20 m × 20 m (aspect). Curvature variables are much less significant. Studies that use them should begin with a careful analysis of their behaviour according to the scale used to compute them. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The growth and spread of new polyploid populations have been explained in terms of fitness advantages over their diploid progenitors. However, a fitness advantage is not sufficient to insure the establishment of a polyploid; it must also overcome the obstacles of demographic stochasticity and minority disadvantage. Several studies have addressed the population dynamics of autopolyploids, but the present study is the first to consider allopolyploids, which are affected by more factors than autopolyploids.METHODS: We constructed a population dynamic model of four types of plants (two parent species, hybrids, allopolyploids) that also included an explicit breeding system.KEY RESULTS: The numbers of plants of each type were the most important factors determining whether the new allopolyploid would become established. More polyploid plants greatly increased the likelihood of polyploid persistence. More plants of the parent species and more hybrids resulted in more polyploids being produced. The model parameters with the most effect on polyploid establishment were potential population size (K), individual plant fecundity, and niche separation ($\alpha$). The most important breeding system parameters were selfing rates, which mitigated minority disadvantage imposed by pollen limitation.CONCLUSIONS: The importance of population sizes, and the parameters that controlled them, in overcoming demographic stochasticity parallels the well-recognized role of propagule pressure in determining the success of invasive species. We modeled the establishment of a new allopolyploid; analogous considerations would affect the establishment of a new autopolyploid. The critical role of population sizes in polyploid establishment should be more widely recognized.},

Where the total pool of available carbohydrate remained more-or-less constant over time, greater C allocation to stolon tissue was associated with reduced allocation to new leaf growth between d 7 and d 49. Rapid death of old stolon material began about d 70, perhaps as the result of withdrawal of C previously supplied to stolon tissue by leaves at the apex. Current assimilate no longer needed to maintain this old stolon material was, in part, reallocated to the apex region. Stolon death was greater when stolons were covered rather than fully illuminated, reflecting the elimination of direct CO2 assimilation by stolon tissue (estimated to be 12-22 {\%} as efficient as leaves in assimilating CO2, on a surface area basis) and accentuation of the carbohydrate deficit. Respiration accounted for an estimated 32 {\%} of C fixed by leaves on d 85 when stolons were covered, compared to 25 {\%} when stolons were fully illuminated. The relevance of these results to the seasonal changes in plant morphology in pastures, and the effects of stolon burial, are discussed.},

abstract = {White clover is polymorphic for cyanogenesis (HCN production after tissue damage), and this herbivore defence polymorphism has served as a classic model for studying adaptive variation. The cyanogenic phenotype requires two interacting biochemical components; the presence/absence of each component is controlled by a simple Mendelian gene (Ac/ac and Li/li). Climate-associated cyanogenesis clines occur in both native (Eurasian) and introduced populations worldwide, with cyanogenic plants predominating in warmer locations. Moreover, previous studies have suggested that epistatic selection may act within populations to maintain cyanogenic (AcLi) plants and acyanogenic plants that lack both components (acli plants) at the expense of plants possessing a single component (Acli and acLi plants). Here, we examine the roles of selection, gene flow and demography in the evolution of a latitudinal cyanogenesis cline in introduced North American populations. Using 1145 plants sampled across a 1650 km transect, we determine the distribution of cyanogenesis variation across the central United States and investigate whether clinal variation is adaptive or an artefact of population introduction history. We also test for the evidence of epistatic selection. We detect a clear latitudinal cline, with cyanogenesis frequencies increasing from 11{\%} to 86{\%} across the transect. Population structure analysis using nine microsatellite loci indicates that the cline is adaptive and not a by-product of demographic history. However, we find no evidence for epistatic selection within populations. Our results provide strong evidence for rapid adaptive evolution in these introduced populations, and they further suggest that the mechanisms maintaining adaptive variation may vary among populations of a species.},

abstract = {A model is proposed that attempts to explain the coexistence of leaves that produce cyanide and leaves that do not produce cyanide in populations of plants. This model is based on an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) calculation, taking into account the behavior of the herbivores on the one hand and the cost of producing cyanide on the other. The cost of cyanogenesis is the balancing force that maintains the acyanogenic phenotype against herbivores favoring cyanogenesis; temperature can act either as a secondary factor influencing herbivore distribution or as a direct factor influencing the cost. For individual plants, there is an optimum frequency of cyanogenic leaves according to cost and herbivory. However, when several individuals (genets) are present, the ESS is lower than the optimum. This phenomenon is compared to Batesian mimicry. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1992 The University of Chicago},

abstract = {A universal barcode system for land plants would be a valuable resource, with potential utility in fields as diverse as ecology, floristics, law enforcement and industry. However, the application of plant barcoding has been constrained by a lack of consensus regarding the most variable and technically practical DNA region(s). We compared eight candidate plant barcoding regions from the plastome and one from the mitochondrial genome for how well they discriminated the monophyly of 92 species in 32 diverse genera of land plants (N = 251 samples). The plastid markers comprise portions of five coding (rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL, matK and 23S rDNA) and three non-coding (trnH-psbA, atpF-atpH, and psbK-psbI) loci. Our survey included several taxonomically complex groups, and in all cases we examined multiple populations and species. The regions differed in their ability to discriminate species, and in ease of retrieval, in terms of amplification and sequencing success. Single locus resolution ranged from 7{\%} (23S rDNA) to 59{\%} (trnH-psbA) of species with well-supported monophyly. Sequence recovery rates were related primarily to amplification success (85-100{\%} for plastid loci), with matK requiring the greatest effort to achieve reasonable recovery (88{\%} using 10 primer pairs). Several loci (matK, psbK-psbI, trnH-psbA) were problematic for generating fully bidirectional sequences. Setting aside technical issues related to amplification and sequencing, combining the more variable plastid markers provided clear benefits for resolving species, although with diminishing returns, as all combinations assessed using four to seven regions had only marginally different success rates (69-71{\%}; values that were approached by several two- and three-region combinations). This performance plateau may indicate fundamental upper limits on the precision of species discrimination that is possible with DNA barcoding systems that include moderate numbers of plastid markers. Resolution to the contentious debate on plant barcoding should therefore involve increased attention to practical issues related to the ease of sequence recovery, global alignability, and marker redundancy in multilocus plant DNA barcoding systems.},

abstract = {Natural selection commonly drives the origin of species, as Darwin initially claimed. Mechanisms of speciation by selection fall into two broad categories: ecological and mutation-order. Under ecological speciation, divergence is driven by divergent natural selection between environments, whereas under mutation-order speciation, divergence occurs when different mutations arise and are fixed in separate populations adapting to similar selection pressures. Tests of parallel evolution of reproductive isolation, trait-based assortative mating, and reproductive isolation by active selection have demonstrated that ecological speciation is a common means by which new species arise. Evidence for mutation-order speciation by natural selection is more limited and has been best documented by instances of reproductive isolation resulting from intragenomic conflict. However, we still have not identified all aspects of selection, and identifying the underlying genes for reproductive isolation remains challenging.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the genetic basis of divergence in mating signal characters that contribute to reproductive isolation is critical to understanding speciation. Here, we describe a semi-automated system for characterizing grasshopper acoustic signals. We used this system to study the genetic basis of divergence in three male calling song components [echeme (EL), syllable (SL) and phrase (PL) lengths] between Chorthippus brunneus and C. jacobsi, two species of grasshoppers that hybridize in northern Spain. We also studied the number of pegs in the stridulatory file. For all characters, additive effects accounted for most of the genetic differentiation between species. However, the three song components also showed small but significant epistatic effects. No sex linkage was detected. Wright-Castle-Lande estimates of the minimum numbers of genetic factors underlying song and peg number divergence were low: peg number (n(e)=5.87+/-5.84), SL (n(e)=2.37+/-4.79) and PL (n(e)=0.87+/-0.86). On the other hand, EL appeared to be controlled by many genes. These results suggest that divergence in SL and PL might be driven by sexual selection whereas EL might not be under selection. This is consistent with experimental results on female song preference in related species. However, the fact that few factors appear to underlie the differences in peg number is surprising. Peg number is not closely related to song characteristics. It often varies between closely related grasshopper species and it has been assumed to be a neutral character. The biometrical approaches used here tend to underestimate the number of factors influencing a trait but provide valuable background for subsequent quantitative trait loci analyses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sexually deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys attract their pollinators, male insects, on a highly specific basis through the emission of odour blends that mimic the female sex pheromone of the targeted species. In this study, we have investigated a contact site between Ophrys arachnitiformis and O. lupercalis, two sympatric orchid species that are usually reproductively isolated via the exploitation of different pollinator "niches", but occasionally hybridise despite their apparent combination of ethological and mechanical isolation barriers. In particular, we have investigated the extent to which these Ophrys hybrids generate "emergent" combinations (i.e. novel and unpredictable from the parents' phenotypes) of floral traits, and how these phenotypic novelties, particularly the odour blends emitted by the flower, could facilitate the invasion of a novel pollinator "niche" and induce the rapid formation of reproductive isolation, a prerequisite for adaptive evolutionary divergence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our chemical analyses of floral scents show that the Ophrys F1 hybrids investigated here produce more compounds, significantly different ratios ({\%} of odour compounds in the total blend), as well as new compounds in their floral odour compared to their progenitors. When tested for their attractiveness to the pollinator of each parent orchid species, we found that floral scent extracts of the hybrids triggered less inspecting flights and contacts by the male bees with the scented dummy than those of the parental orchid species. However, a series of additional behavioural bioassays revealed that the novel floral scent of the hybrids was significantly more attractive than either of the two parents to a pollinator species not initially involved in the pollination of any of the parent Ophrys species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results illustrate that the process of hybridisation can lead to the generation of evolutionary novelties, and that novel combinations of floral traits can drive pollinator shifts and rapid reproductive isolation in highly specific plant-pollinator interactions.},

abstract = {We determine the contribution of composite additive, dominance, and epistatic effects to the genetic divergence of photoperiodic response along latitudinal, altitudinal, and longitudinal gradients in the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. Joint scaling tests of crosses between populations showed widespread epistasis as well as additive and dominance differences among populations. There were differences due to epistasis between an alpine population in North Carolina and populations in Florida, lowland North Carolina, and Maine. Longitudinal displacement resulted in differences due to epistasis between Florida and Alabama populations separated by 300 km but not between Maine and Wisconsin populations separated by 2000 km. Genetic differences between New Jersey and Ontario did not involve either dominance or epistasis and we estimated the minimum number of effective factors contributing to a difference in mean critical photoperiod of 5 SD between them as nE = 5. We propose that the genetic similarity of populations within a broad northern region is due to their more recent origin since recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and that the unique genetic architecture of each population is the result of both mutation and repeated migration-founder-flush episodes during the dispersal of W. smithii in North America. Our results suggest that differences in composite additive and dominance effects arise early in the genetic divergence of populations while differences due to epistasis accumulate after more prolonged isolation.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular evolution of genes that underlie intraspecific polymorphisms can provide insights into the process of adaptive evolution. For adaptive polymorphisms characterized by gene presence/absence (P/A) variation, underlying loci commonly show signatures of long-term balancing selection, with gene-presence and gene-absence alleles maintained as two divergent lineages. We examined the molecular evolution of two unlinked P/A polymorphisms that underlie a well-documented adaptive polymorphism for cyanogenesis (hydrogen cyanide release with tissue damage) in white clover. Both cyanogenic and acyanogenic plants occur in this species, and the ecological forces that maintain this chemical defence polymorphism have been studied for several decades. Using a sample of 65 plants, we investigated the molecular evolution of sequences flanking the two underlying cyanogenesis genes: Ac/ac (controlling the presence/absence of cyanogenic glucosides) and Li/li (controlling the presence/absence of their hydrolysing enzyme, linamarase). A combination of genome walking, PCR assays, DNA sequence analysis and Southern blotting was used to test whether these adaptive P/A polymorphisms show evidence of long-term balancing selection, or whether gene-absence alleles have evolved repeatedly through independent deletion events. For both loci, we detect no signatures of balancing selection in the closest flanking genomic sequences. Instead, we find evidence for variation in the size of the deletions characterizing gene-absence alleles. These observations strongly suggest that both of these polymorphisms have been evolving through recurrent gene deletions over time. We discuss the genetic mechanisms that could account for this surprising pattern and the implications of these findings for mechanisms of rapid adaptive evolution in white clover.},

These populations had geographically distant ({\textgreater} 2000 km) origins but evolved in a uniform laboratory environment for 120 generations. For each pair of populations (Nigeria x Yemen and Cameroon x Uganda) we estimated the means of five fitness-related characters and a measure of fitness (net reproductive rate R0) in each of the parental populations and 12 types of hybrids (two F1 and two F2 lines and eight backcrosses). Models containing up to nine composite genetic parameters were fitted to the means of the 14 lines. The patterns of line means for all traits in the Nigeria x Yemen cross and for four traits (larval survival, developmental rate, female body weight, and fecundity) in the Cameroon x Uganda cross were best explained by models including additive, dominance, and maternal effects, but excluding epistasis. We did not find any evidence for outbreeding depression for any trait. An epistatic component of divergence was detected for egg hatching success and R0 in the Cameroon x Uganda cross, but its sign was opposite to that expected under outbreeding depression, that is, additive x additive epistasis had a positive effect on the performance of F2 hybrids. All traits except fecundity showed a pattern of heterosis. A large difference of egg-hatching success between the two reciprocal F1 lines in that cross was best explained as fertilization incompatibility between Cameroon females and sperm carrying Uganda genes. The results suggest that these populations have not converged to the same life-history phenotype and genetic architecture, despite 120 generations of uniform natural selection. However, the absence of outbreeding depression implies that they did not evolve toward different adaptive peaks.},

Seedling recruitment was several orders of magnitude less than vegetative recruitment in both lawn and pasture populations. However, at least several new genets are added to these populations on a yearly basis. In both locations, physical disturbances may open sites for seed germination, as disturbed sites had higher seed germination rates than undisturbed sites. However, these sites were not favorable for long-term establishment due to such factors as frost upheaval. Therefore, there are trade-offs in safe site attributes for seed germination and establishment that strongly limit recruitment in natural populations of white clover.},

abstract = {Instances of parallel ecotypic divergence where adaptation to similar conditions repeatedly cause similar phenotypic changes in closely related organisms are useful for studying the role of ecological selection in speciation. Here we used a combination of traditional and next generation genotyping techniques to test for the parallel divergence of plants from the Senecio lautus complex, a phenotypically variable groundsel that has adapted to disparate environments in the South Pacific. Phylogenetic analysis of a broad selection of Senecio species showed that members of the S. lautus complex form a distinct lineage that has diversified recently in Australasia. An inspection of thousands of polymorphisms in the genome of 27 natural populations from the S. lautus complex in Australia revealed a signal of strong genetic structure independent of habitat and phenotype. Additionally, genetic differentiation between populations was correlated with the geographical distance separating them, and the genetic diversity of populations strongly depended on geographical location. Importantly, coastal forms appeared in several independent phylogenetic clades, a pattern that is consistent with the parallel evolution of these forms. Analyses of the patterns of genomic differentiation between populations further revealed that adjacent populations displayed greater genomic heterogeneity than allopatric populations and are differentiated according to variation in soil composition. These results are consistent with a process of parallel ecotypic divergence in face of gene flow.},

abstract = {To evaluate possible evolutionary links between plant–herbivore and plant–pollinator relationships, defense and reward characteristics and pollination ecology were mapped onto a morphologically estimated phylogeny of 42 species of Dalechampia. This procedure generated detailed hypotheses about the evolution of anti-herbivore defense and pollination systems. These hypotheses were tested using the results of chemical analyses and bioassays of foliar and floral secretions. Multiple lines of defense appear to have evolved in sequence in Dalechampia. The first defense system to originate was deployment of triterpene resins to defend the staminate flowers. This feature was a preaptation (preadaptation) that allowed the evolution of a resin-based, pollinator-reward system. Thus pollination by resin-collecting bees originated as a “transfer exaptation” (a new function replaced the old). This hypothesis is supported by anti-herbivore activities of floral resins and by chemical similarity of floral defense and reward resins. After the resin defense of flowers was lost by conversion into a reward system, there followed (in evolutionary time) a sequence of defensive innovations. These included nocturnal closure of large, involucral bracts to protect both staminate and pistillate flowers. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the large bracts themselves probably originated as a floral advertisement system, and the bracts assumed a defensive function through “addition exaptation” (a new function was added to the old). Additional lines of defense to evolve were deployment of resin to defend the developing ovaries and seeds (an addition exaptation), deployment of sharp, detaching trichomes on enveloping sepals to defend developing seeds (apparent adaptations), closure of involucral bracts around the developing fruits and seeds (an addition exaptation), and deployment of resin to defend the leaves and growing shoot tips (also an addition exaptation). Support for this scenario also derives from the chemical similarities of sepal, foliar, and floral resins, and the anti-herbivore properties of foliar resins. It appears that at least one pollinator-reward system originated by modification of a defense system, and several defense systems originated by modification of pollinator reward and advertisement systems. Thus exaptations have been important in the origin of new defense and pollination systems, and each system has significantly influenced the evolution of the other on several occasions.},

Despite such beneficial activity, the state of public understanding of evolution is considered woefully lacking by most researchers and educators. This lack of understanding affects evolution/science literacy, research, and academia in general. Not only does the general public lack an understanding of evolution but so does a considerable proportion of college graduates. However, it is not just evolutionary concepts that students do not retain. In general, college students retain little of what they supposedly have learned. Worse yet, it is not just students who have avoided science and math who fail to retain fundamental science concepts. Students who have had extensive secondary-level and college courses in science have similar deficits. We examine these issues and explore what distinguishes effective pedagogy from ineffective pedagogy in higher education in general and evolution education in particular. The fundamental problem of students' prior conceptions is considered and why prior conceptions often underpin students' misunderstanding of the evolutionary concepts being taught. These conceptions can often be discovered and addressed. We also attend to concerns about coverage of course content and the influence of religious beliefs, and provide helpful strategies to improve college-level teaching of evolution.},

These mutations may have different persistence depending on their fitnesses, but collectively, they constitute the ultimate source of genetic variability in the populations. Since the maintenance of genetic variability is an important subject of study in population genetics, it may be worthwhile to investigate, using various models, the effect of mutation on the genetic variability. For example, Kimura and Crow (1964) studied the number of alleles maintained in a finite population, assuming that each mutant is an allele not preexisting in the population. In the present paper I will use a different model and will investigate the number of heterozygous sites per individual and some related quantities that represent the statistical properties of the mutant frequency distribution, assuming that a very large number of independent sites are available for mutation. In this paper, site refers to a single nucleotide pair, although the theory is still appropriate to a small group of nucleotides, such as a codon.},

Despite this parameter's central importance to population genetic models, until recently we have known relatively little about the value of s in natural populations. With the development of molecular genetic techniques in the late 20th century and the sequencing technologies that followed, biologists are now able to identify genetic variants and directly relate them to organismal fitness. We reviewed the literature for published estimates of natural selection acting at the genetic level and found over 3000 estimates of selection coefficients from 79 studies. Selection coefficients were roughly exponentially distributed, suggesting that the impact of selection at the genetic level is generally weak but can occasionally be quite strong. We used both nonparametric statistics and formal random-effects meta-analysis to determine how selection varies across biological and methodological categories. Selection was stronger when measured over shorter timescales, with the mean magnitude of s greatest for studies that measured selection within a single generation. Our analyses found conflicting trends when considering how selection varies with the genetic scale (e.g., SNPs or haplotypes) at which it is measured, suggesting a need for further research. Besides these quantitative conclusions, we highlight key issues in the calculation, interpretation, and reporting of selection coefficients and provide recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {Insect herbivores search for their host plants in heterogeneous environments, and the efficiency of host location may be influenced by plant architecture and abundance. In this study, we ask how plant and habitat characteristics traditionally thought to attract pollinators are related to attack rates by floral herbivores. Patterns of floral herbivory by the moth larva Eupithecia pulchellata were studied in relation to inflorescence size and local plant density in two years in a natural population of the facultative biennial Digitalis purpurea. Overall levels of herbivory were low, 84{\%} of the infested plants lost less than 10{\%} of their flowers. Only 9{\%} of the plants lost more than 20{\%} of their flowers. Probability of herbivory at the plant level increased strongly with inflorescence height, and it was considerably higher in dense patches compared to sparse ones. There was no effect of local plant density on the functional relationship between inflorescence size and probability of herbivory. Both number and proportion of damaged flowers per plant increased with inflorescence height. The results suggest that E. pulchellata is attracted to dense patches and large individuals of D. purpurea, and that negative effects of herbivory increase with plant size. This implies diminishing returns for investment in more flowers in D. purpurea, and indicates that herbivory may select for smaller flowering size and flower number in this monocarpic species. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = { $\backslash$nA survivorship curve is shaped by the differential survivability of the organisms within the population, and a change in a survivorship curve with a stressor reflects the differential response of the organisms to the stressor. Quantifying this linkage in a simple, rigorous way is valuable for characterizing the response of populations to stressors and ultimately for understanding the evolutionary selection of individuals exposed to stressors. To quantify this stressor–individual–population linkage with as few parameters as possible, I present a simple mechanistic model describing organism survival in terms of age-dependent and age-independent mortality rates. The age-independent rate is represented by a Poisson process. For the age-dependent rate, a concept of vitality is defined, and mortality occurs when an organism's vitality is exhausted. The loss of vitality over age is represented by a continuous Brownian-motion process, the Weiner process; vitality-related mortality occurs when the random process reaches the boundary of zero vitality. The age at which vitality-related mortality occurs is represented by the Weiner-process probability distribution for first-arrival time. The basic model has three rate parameters: the rate of accidental mortality, the mean rate of vitality loss, and the variability in the rate of vitality loss. These rates are related to body mass, environmental conditions, and xenobiotic stressors, resulting in a model that characterizes intrinsic and extrinsic factors that control a population's survival and the distribution of vitality of its individuals. The model assumes that these factors contribute to the rate parameters additively and linearly. $\backslash$nThe model is evaluated with case studies across a range of species exposed to natural and xenobiotic stressors. The mean rate of vitality loss generally is the dominant factor in determining the shape of survival curves under optimal conditions. Xenobiotic stressors add to the mean rate in proportion to the strength of the stressor. The base, or intrinsic, vitality loss rate is proportional to the −1/3 power of adult body mass across a range of iteroparous species. The increase in vitality loss rate with a xenobiotic stressor can be a function of body mass according to the allometric relationship of the organism structures affected by the stressor. The model's applicability to dose–response studies is illustrated with case studies including natural stressors (temperature, feeding interval, and population density) and xenobiotic stressors (organic and inorganic toxicants). The model provides a way to extrapolate the impact of stressors measured in one environment to another environment; by characterizing how stressors alter the vitality probability distribution, it can quantify the degree to which a stressor differentiates members of a population. },

To address these questions, we examined a pair of ecologically divergent pine-sawfly species: while Neodiprion pinetum specializes on a thin-needled pine (Pinus strobus), N. lecontei utilizes thicker-needled pines. We hypothesized that extrinsic postzygotic isolation is generated by oviposition traits. To test this hypothesis, we assayed ovipositor morphology, oviposition behavior, and host-dependent oviposition success in both species and in F1 and backcross females. Compared to N. lecontei, N. pinetum females preferred P. strobus more strongly, had smaller ovipositors, and laid fewer eggs per needle. Additionally, we observed host- and trait-dependent reductions in oviposition success in F1 and backcross females. Hybrid females that had pinetum-like host preference (P. strobus) and lecontei-like oviposition traits (morphology and egg pattern) fared especially poorly. Together, these data indicate that maladaptive combinations of oviposition traits in hybrids contribute to extrinsic postzygotic isolation between N. lecontei and N. pinetum, suggesting that oviposition traits may be an important driver of divergence in phytophagous insects.},

WHO and UNEP created an air pollution monitoring network as part of the Global Environment Monitoring System.

A study of air pollution in 20 of the 24 megacities of the world (over 10 million people by year 2000) shows that ambient air pollution concentrations are at levels where serious health effects are reported. The expected rise of population in the next century, mainly in the developing countries with a lack of capital for air pollution control, means that there is a great potential that conditions will worsen in many more cities that will reach megacity status. This paper maps the potential for air pollution that cities will experience in the future unless control strategies are developed and implemented during the next several decades.},

We analysed differentiation patterns for Aat-1 and another four loci among populations from both habitat types in the French Alps. We showed that the Aat-1(A) allele is favoured within hypogeous habitats but selected against within epigeous habitats. Comparisons of our results with other data reported in the literature indicate that the Aat-1(A) allele is generally evolving under habitat-differential selection, but that the precise balance of migration and selection that determines equilibrium allele frequencies varies greatly across Europe. The nature of this habitat-dependent selection, and its resulting (geographically varying) equilibrium point, are discussed in relation to the biology of this mosquito species},

Consequently, the independent evolution of similar phenotypes is predicted to occur through different genetic mechanisms. The genetic basis of adaptation is still largely unknown, however, and it is unclear whether adaptation to new environments utilizes ubiquitous small-effect polygenic variation or large-effect alleles at a small number of loci. To address this question, we examined the genetic basis of bony armor loss in three freshwater populations of Alaskan threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, that evolved from fully armored anadromous populations in the last 14,000 years. Crosses between complete-armor and low-armor populations revealed that a single Mendelian factor governed the formation of all but the most anterior lateral plates, and another independently segregating factor largely determined pelvic armor. Genetic mapping localized the Mendelian genes to different chromosomal regions, and crosses among these same three widely separated populations showed that both bony plates and pelvic armor failed to fully complement, implicating the same Mendelian armor reduction genes. Thus, rapid and repeated armor loss in Alaskan stickleback populations appears to be occurring through the fixation of large-effect variants in the same genes.},

abstract = {Three species of the asteroid genus Patiriella occur sympatrically in New South Wales and the possibility for hybridization among them was examined through a series of cross-fertilization experiments. Patiriella calcar and P. gunnii are morphologically distinct as adults but indistinguishable as larvae. Patiriella exigua is morphologically distinct in both its adult and larval morphologies. The gametes of P. calcar and P. gunnii were reciprocally compatible: laboratory crosses between these species produced viable hybrid juveniles. In crosses between female P. calcar and male P. gunnii, most of the juveniles metamorphosed with an arm number intermediate between that of the parents, whereas crosses between female P. gunnii and male P. calcar produced juveniles with an arm number more similar to the maternal phenotype. Heterospecific crosses with P. exigua resulted in low fertilization rates, and viable hybrids were not produced. This species appears capable of self-fertilization. Because hybrids between P. calcar and P. gunnii were viable, neither gametic incompatibility nor hybrid inviability appears to ensure reproductive isolation between these species. Ecological or habitat segregation and temporal separation in breeding may isolate these species in the field. The results demonstrate that if gamete surface recognition molecules are involved in fertilization of P. calcar and P gunnii, then they are not strongly species specific, at least at the sperm concentrations used in this study. Reproductive isolation between these species has evolved despite their gametic compatibility. In contrast, P. exigua is isolated from its congeners because of gametic incompatibility and several features characteristic of its reproduction and development. The implications of these findings for reproductive isolation and speciation of Patiriella and for the evolution of reproductive isolation in free-spawning marine organisms are discussed.

abstract = {Changes in ploidy occurred early in the diversification of some animal and plant lineages and represent an ongoing phenomenon in others. While the prevalence of polyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on patterns and rates of diversification remains an open question. Here we review evidence for the creative role of polyploidy in evolution. We present new estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transitions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. These new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4{\%} of speciation events in flowering plants and 7{\%} in ferns. Speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. Theoretical models support the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. The evidence suggests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive.},

abstract = {Speciation is facilitated when selection generates a rugged fitness landscape such that populations occupy different peaks separated by valleys. Competition for food resources is a strong ecological force that can generate such divergent selection. However, it is unclear whether intrasexual competition over resources that provide mating opportunities can generate rugged fitness landscapes that foster speciation. Here we use highly variable male F2 hybrids of benthic and limnetic threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus Linnaeus, 1758, to quantify the male competition fitness landscape. We find that disruptive sexual selection generates two fitness peaks corresponding closely to the male phenotypes of the two parental species, favouring divergence. Most surprisingly, an additional region of high fitness favours novel hybrid phenotypes that correspond to those observed in a recent case of reverse speciation after anthropogenic disturbance. Our results reveal that sexual selection through male competition plays an integral role in both forward and reverse speciation.},

abstract = {Logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between six submerged macrophyte taxa ( Chara spp., Potamogeton perfoliatus , Potamogeton pectinatus , Potamogeton pusillus , Myriophyllum spicatum , Alisma gramineum and sum of all species) and four environmental variables (turbidity, effective wind fetch, water depth and sediment silt percentage, including interactions and some quadratic terms). The models were based on intensive vegetation samples (total c. 72 000) and other monitoring data carried out in five Dutch shallow lakes in the IJsselmeer area from 1988 to 1998. Water depth and light extinction were the most important factors determining the occurrence of all studied species in Veluwemeer, while effective wind fetch had a moderate effect and sediment silt had only a minor effect on the occurrence. Water depth had a negative impact on all species, except A. gramineum , which showed an optimum response. Three species showed an optimum response at intermediate turbidity ( M. spicatum , P. pusillus and P. pectinatus ), whereas the other taxa were negatively related. Three species ( Chara spp., P. perfoliatus and M. spicatum ) were positively related to wind fetch or showed an optimum response at intermediate value, whereas P. pusillus , P. pectinatus and A. gramineum were negatively related. The models including interactions between the explanatory variables showed a high goodness of fit for Veluwemeer for Chara , P. pectinatus and M. spicatum (in more than 8 of 10 instances, a cell originally scored `1' are predicted to have a higher probability than the ones originally scored `0'). The models of the other species showed a moderate goodness of fit (between 6 and 8 of 10 instances correctly predicted). The models developed for Veluwemeer were valid for Chara in all the four other lakes (more than 8 of 10 instances correctly predicted), while the models of other species were valid in some instances. A succession of vegetation was recognised based on water depth and turbidity in Veluwemeer. P. perfoliatus and P. pectinatus dominated the shallow zones under turbid conditions, but a change to dominance by Chara occurred in clear water. Based on the observation of co-occurrence, competition has played an important role for the shift from P. pectinatus to Chara . Chara became dominant 2 years after initial colonisation of Chara in P. pectinatus beds. Competition between P. perfoliatus and Chara may have been of less importance, due to a more distinct habitat (deeper colonisation) of dense P. perfoliatus beds. The analysed species showed large differences in vegetation stability from year-to-year. Chara showed the highest year to year stability (c. 65{\%} of the cells remained covered from one year to another), while A. gramineum showed the highest dynamics (c. 10{\%} of the cells remained covered from one year to another). Species producing specialized vegetative propagules for over wintering showed a higher local stability than species without such propagules.},

abstract = {A model of speciation has been constructed involving two loci under natural selection in two subpopulations, with different alleles adapted to the different subpopulations. Progress toward speciation in this model consists of association of a third locus, at which there is assortative mating, with the original two loci. Cases can be found in which speciation cannot occur. The evolutionary force acting against speciation turns out to be recombination, which acts to randomize the association between the prezygotic isolating mechanism (assortative mating) and the adaptations to the two environments. This model suggests that there is an important distinction between two kinds of speciation. One involves speciation by substitution of the same alleles in the two nascent species, the other by substitution of different alleles. Only in the latter case does recombination act as a force retarding or blocking speciation.},

@article{Randin2006,
abstract = {Aim To assess the geographical transferability of niche-based species distribution models fitted with two modelling techniques. Location Two distinct geographical study areas in Switzerland and Austria, in the subalpine and alpine belts. Methods Generalized linear and generalized additive models (GLM and GAM) with a binomial probability distribution and a logit link were fitted for 54 plant species, based on topoclimatic predictor variables. These models were then evaluated quantitatively and used for spatially explicit predictions within (internal evaluation and prediction) and between (external evaluation and prediction) the two regions. Comparisons of evaluations and spatial predictions between regions and models were conducted in order to test if species and methods meet the criteria of full transferability. By full transferability, we mean that: (1) the internal evaluation of models fitted in region A and B must be similar; (2) a model fitted in region A must at least retain a comparable external evaluation when projected into region B, and vice-versa; and (3) internal and external spatial predictions have to match within both regions. Results The measures of model fit are, on average, 24{\%} higher for GAMs than for GLMs in both regions. However, the differences between internal and external evaluations (AUC coefficient) are also higher for GAMs than for GLMs (a difference of 30{\%} for models fitted in Switzerland and 54{\%} for models fitted in Austria). Transferability, as measured with the AUC evaluation, fails for 68{\%} of the species in Switzerland and 55{\%} in Austria for GLMs (respectively for 67{\%} and 53{\%} of the species for GAMs). For both GAMs and GLMs, the agreement between internal and external predictions is rather weak on average (Kulczynski's coefficient in the range 0.3–0.4), but varies widely among individual species. The dominant pattern is an asymmetrical transferability between the two study regions (a mean decrease of 20{\%} for the AUC coefficient when the models are transferred from Switzerland and 13{\%} when they are transferred from Austria). Main conclusions The large inter-specific variability observed among the 54 study species underlines the need to consider more than a few species to test properly the transferability of species distribution models. The pronounced asymmetry in transferability between the two study regions may be due to peculiarities of these regions, such as differences in the ranges of environmental predictors or the varied impact of land-use history, or to species-specific reasons like differential phenotypic plasticity, existence of ecotypes or varied dependence on biotic interactions that are not properly incorporated into niche-based models. The lower variation between internal and external evaluation of GLMs compared to GAMs further suggests that overfitting may reduce transferability.},

Here, we investigate the inheritance of key morphological traits that distinguish the larval types. We used genetic crosses to establish the infuence of maternal and zygotic differences on larval phenotypes. We found a large maternal effect on larval size and the number of larval chaetae, while the number and length of these chaetae were also strongly infuenced by zygotic genotype. Interestingly, the distribution of larval phenotypes produced by these crosses suggests traits intermediate to the two parental types should not be uncommon. Yet, despite gene fow between the types in natural populations, such intermediates are rarely found in nature, suggesting that selection may be maintaining distinct larval modes. {\textcopyright} 2014 UBC Press Printed in Spain.},

abstract = {The analysis of food webs and their dynamics facilitates understanding of the mechanistic processes behind community ecology and ecosystem functions. Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution, recent DNA-based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially, this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on-going decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account when choosing or designing a suitable barcode. Then, we consider both technical and analytical aspects of NGS diet studies. Finally, we discuss the validation of data accuracy including the viability of producing quantitative data.},

However, although divergent selection often initiates the process of speciation, it often fails to complete it. Several time-based, geographic and genetic factors have been recognized to explain this variability in how far speciation proceeds. We review here recent evidence indicating that variability in the completeness of speciation can also be associated with the nature of divergent selection itself, with speciation being greatly promoted by (i) stronger selection on a given, single trait (the 'stronger selection' hypothesis) and (ii) selection on a greater number of traits (the 'multifarious selection' hypothesis). However, evidence for each selective hypothesis is still scarce, and further work is required to determine their relative importance. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {DNA barcoding based on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) sequence is being employed for diverse groups of animals with demonstrated success in species identification and new species discovery. Applying barcoding systems to land plants will be a more challenging task as plant genome substitution rates are considerably lower than those observed in animal mitochondria, suggesting that a much greater amount of sequence data from multiple loci will be required to barcode plants. In the absence of an obvious well-characterized plant locus that meets all the necessary criteria, a key first step will be identifying candidate regions with the most potential. To meet the challenges with land plants, we are proposing the adoption of a tiered approach wherein highly variable loci are nested under a core barcoding gene. Analysis of over 10 000 rbcL sequences from GenBank demonstrate that this locus could serve well as the core region, with sufficient variation to discriminate among species in approximate...},

The proportion of mutations that are advantageous, effectively neutral and deleterious varies between species, and the DFE differs between coding and non-coding DNA.

While slow mutation‐limited adaptation leads to classical footprints of ‘hard' selective sweeps, these patterns are different when adaptation responds quickly to a novel selection pressure, acting either on standing genetic variation or on recurrent new mutation. In the past decade, corresponding footprints of ‘soft' selective sweeps have been described both in theoretical models and in empirical data. 2. Here, we summarize the key theoretical concepts and contrast model predictions with observed patterns in Drosophila, humans, and microbes. 3. Evidence in all cases shows that ‘soft' patterns of rapid adaptation are frequent. However, theory and data also point to a role of complex adaptive histories in rapid evolution. 4. While existing theory allows for important implications on the tempo and mode of the adaptive process, complex footprints observed in data are, as yet, insufficiently covered by models. They call for in‐depth empirical study and further model development.},

abstract = {Despite the importance of plant-herbivore interactions to the ecology and evolution of terrestrial ecosystems, the evolutionary factors contributing to variation in plant defenses against herbivores remain unresolved. We used a comparative phylogenetic approach to examine a previously untested hypothesis (Recombination-Mating System Hypothesis) that posits that reduced sexual reproduction limits adaptive evolution of plant defenses against arthropod herbivores. To test this hypothesis we focused on the evening primrose family (Onagraceae), which includes both sexual and functionally asexual species. Ancestral state reconstructions on a 5-gene phylogeny of the family revealed between 18 and 21 independent transitions between sexual and asexual reproduction. Based on these analyses, we examined susceptibility to herbivores on 32 plant species representing 15 independent transitions. Generalist caterpillars consumed 32{\%} more leaf tissue, gained 13{\%} greater mass, and experienced 21{\%} higher survival on functionally asexual than on sexual plant species. Survival of a generalist feeding mite was 19{\%} higher on asexual species. In a field experiment, generalist herbivores consumed 64{\%} more leaf tissue on asexual species. By contrast, a specialist beetle fed more on sexual than asexual species, suggesting that a tradeoff exists between the evolution of defense to generalist and specialist herbivores. Measures of putative plant defense traits indicate that both secondary compounds and physical leaf characteristics may mediate this tradeoff. These results support the Recombination-Mating System Hypothesis and suggest that variation in sexual reproduction among plant species may play an important, yet overlooked, role in shaping the macroevolution of plant defenses against arthropod herbivores.},

abstract = {The climatic conditions of mountain habitats are greatly influenced by topography. Large differences in microclimate occur with small changes in elevation, and this complex interaction is an important determinant of mountain plant distributions. In spite of this, elevation is not often considered as a relevant predictor in species distribution models (SDMs) for mountain plants. Here, we evaluated the importance of including elevation as a predictor in SDMs for mountain plant species. We generated two sets of SDMs for each of 73 plant species that occur in the Pacific Northwest of North America; one set of models included elevation as a predictor variable and the other set did not. AUC scores indicated that omitting elevation as a predictor resulted in a negligible reduction of model performance. However, further analysis revealed that the omission of elevation resulted in large over-predictions of species' niche breadths—this effect was most pronounced for species that occupy the highest elevations. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a predictor constrained the effects of other predictors that superficially affected the outcome of the models generated without elevation. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of elevation as a predictor variable improves the quality of SDMs for high-elevation plant species. Because of the negligible AUC score penalty for over-predicting niche breadth, our results support the notion that AUC scores alone should not be used as a measure of model quality. More generally, our results illustrate the importance of selecting biologically relevant predictor variables when constructing SDMs},

abstract = {Emerging evidence that cities drive micro-evolution raises the question of whether rapid urbanization of Earth might impact ecosystems by causing systemic changes in functional traits that regulate urban ecosystems' productivity and stability. Intraspecific trait variation—variation in organisms' morphological, physiological or behavioural characteristics stemming from genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity—has significant implications for ecological functions such as nutrient cycling and primary productivity. While it is well established that changes in ecological conditions can drive evolutionary change in species' traits that, in turn, can alter ecosystem function, an understanding of the reciprocal and simultaneous processes associated with such interactions is only beginning to emerge. In urban settings, the potential for rapid trait change may be exacerbated by multiple selection pressures operating simultaneously. This paper reviews evidence on mechanisms linking urban development patterns to rapid phenotypic changes, and differentiates phenotypic changes for which there is evidence of micro-evolution versus phenotypic changes which may represent plasticity. Studying how humans mediate phenotypic trait changes through urbanization could shed light on fundamental concepts in ecological and evolutionary theory. It can also contribute to our understanding of eco-evolutionary feedback and provide insights for maintaining ecosystem function over the long term.},

@article{Grant1997,
abstract = {External (environmental) factors affecting the speciation of birds are better known than the internal (genetic) factors. The opposite is true for several groups of invertebrates, Drosophila being the outstanding example. Ideas about the genetics of speciation in general trace back to Dobzhansky who worked with Drosophila. These ideas are an insufficient guide for reconstructing speciation in birds for two main reasons. First, speciation in birds proceeds with the evolution of behavioral barriers to interbreeding; postmating isolation usually evolves much later, perhaps after gene exchange has all but ceased. As a consequence of the slow evolution of postmating isolating factors the scope for reinforcement of premating isolation is small, whereas the opportunity for introgressive hybridization to influence the evolution of diverging species is large. Second, premating isolation may arise from nongenetic, cultural causes; isolation may be affected partly by song, a trait that is culturally inherited through an imprinting-like process in many, but not all, groups of birds. Thus the genetic basis to the origin of bird species is to be sought in the inheritance of adult traits that are subject to natural and sexual selection. Some of the factors involved in premating isolation (plumage, morphology, and behavior) are under single-gene control, most are under polygenic control. The genetic basis of the origin of postmating isolating factors affecting the early development of embryos (viability) and reproductive physiology (sterility) is almost completely unknown. Bird speciation is facilitated by small population size, involves few genetic changes, and occurs relatively rapidly.},

Our results show reduced genetic diversity, lower effective population sizes, and higher genetic differentiation for spatially isolated urban populations in comparison with populations outside intensely urbanized areas. Reduction of allelic diversity in urban localities isolated for 13–37 generations is more conspicuous than reduction of expected heterozygosity. Populations living close to the River Danube, its branches, and artificial canals are genetically more homogenous. Our results also suggest that the Danube in Bratislava is not a natural barrier to gene flow. In contrast, it acts as a natural corridor for water frog dispersal. Population structure of P. ridibundus also shows higher genetic connectivity within water paths than between them, suggesting limited overland dispersal, and reflects the historical landscape structure associated with the distribution of the lost river branches.},

Because of the physical and psychological discomfort inflicted by their blood feeding habits, and allergies and secondary infections associated with bites, bed bugs are recognized as a significant public health problem. Although bed bug infestations are spreading and becoming more prevalent, we have a poor understanding of their dispersal patterns and sources of infestation. To help fill this gap, we conducted a genetic study of 21 bed bug infestations from the eastern United States, nearly all of which came from single rooms within residences. We genotyped samples comprised of 8-10 individuals per infestation at nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. Despite high genetic diversity across all infestations, with 5-17 alleles per locus (mean = 10.3 alleles per locus), we found low genetic diversity (1-4 alleles per locus) within all but one of the infestations. These results suggest that nearly all the studied infestations were started by a small propagule possibly consisting of a singly mated female and/or her progeny, or a female mated with multiple males that were highly related to her. All infestations were strongly genetically differentiated from each other (mean pairwise F(ST) between populations = 0.68) and we did not find strong evidence of a geographic pattern of genetic structure, indicating infestations located in closer proximity to each other were nearly as genetically differentiated as those located hundreds of kilometers away. The high level of genetic diversity across infestations from the eastern United States together with the lack of geographically organized structure is consistent with multiple introductions into the United States from foreign sources.},

Here, I review recent developments in phylogenetic approaches to understanding the evolution of plant defense strategies and plant-herbivore coevolutionary interactions. I focus particularly on multivariate defense against insect herbivores, which is the simultaneous deployment of multiple traits, often arranged as convergently evolved defense syndromes. Answering many of the outstanding questions in the biology of plant defense will require generating broad hypotheses that can be explicitly tested by using comparative approaches and interpreting phylogenetic patterns. The comparative approach has wide-spread potential to reinvigorate tests of classic hypotheses about the evolution of interspecific interactions. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Prediction of species' distributions is central to diverse applications in ecology, evolution and conservation science. There is increasing electronic access to vast sets of occurrence records in museums and herbaria, yet little effective guidance on how best to use this information in the context of numerous approaches for modelling distributions. To meet this need, we compared 16 modelling methods over 226 species from 6 regions of the world, creating the most comprehensive set of model comparisons to date. We used presence-only data to fit models, and independent presence-absence data to evaluate the predictions. Along with well-established modelling methods such as generalised additive models and GARP and BIOCLIM, we explored methods that either have been developed recently or have rarely been applied to modelling species' distributions. These include machine-learning methods and community models, both of which have features that may make them particularly well suited to noisy or sparse information, as is typical of species' occurrence data. Presence-only data were effective for modelling species' distributions for many species and regions. The novel methods consistently outperformed more established methods. The results of our analysis are promising for the use of data from museums and herbaria, especially as methods suited to the noise inherent in such data improve.},

abstract = {Traditional discussions of speciation are based on geographical patterns of species ranges1,2 . In allopatric speciation, long-term geographical isolation generates reproductively isolated and spatially segregated descendant species1,3 . In the absence of geographical barriers, diversification is hindered by gene flow1,3,4 . Yet a growing body of phylogenetic and experimental data suggests that closely related species often occur in sympatry or have adjacent ranges in regions over which environmental changes are gradual and do not prevent gene flow5–14 . Theory has identified a variety of evolutionary processes that can result in speciation under sympatric conditions15–25 , with some recent advances concentrating on the phenomenon of evolutionary branching18,23–25 . Here we establish a link between geographical patterns and ecological processes of speciation by studying evolutionary branching in spatially structured populations. We show that along an environmental gradient, evolutionary branching can occur much more easily than in non-spatial models. This facilitation is most pronounced for gradients of intermediate slope. Moreover, spatial evolutionary branching readily generates patterns of spatial segregation and abutment between the emerging species. Our results highlight the import- ance of local processes of adaptive divergence for geographical patterns of speciation, and caution against pitfalls of inferring past speciation processes from present biogeographical patterns.},

abstract = {Maternal inheritance is the non-Mendelian transmission of traits from mothers to their offspring. Despite its presence in virtually all organisms, acting through a variety of mechanisms, the evolutionary consequences of maternal inheritance are not well understood. Here we review and extend a model of the inheritance and evolution of multiple quantitative characters with complex pathways of maternal effects. Extensions of the earlier model include common family environmental effects not associated with maternal phenotype, sexual dimorphism, and paternal effects (non-Mendelian influence of the father on offspring traits). We find that, in contrast to simple Mendelian inheritance, maternal inheritance produces qualitatively different evolutionary dynamics for two reasons: (1) the response to selection on a set of characters depends not only on their additive genetic variances and covariances, but also on maternal characters that influence them, and (2) time lags in the response to selection create a form of evolutionary momentum. These results have important implications for evolution in natural populations and practical applications in the economic improvement of domesticated species. We derive selection indices that maximize either the economic improvement in a single generation of artificial selection or the asymptotic rate of improvement in long-term selection programmes, based on individual merit or a combination of individual and family merit. Numerical examples show that accounting for maternal inheritance can lead to considerable increases in the efficiency of artificial selection.},

abstract = {The long history of reciprocal transplant studies testing the hypothesis of local adaptation has shown that populations are often adapted to their local environments. Yet many studies have not demonstrated local adaptation, suggesting that sometimes native populations are no better adapted than are genotypes from foreign environments. Local adaptation may also lead to trade-offs, in which adaptation to one environment comes at a cost of adaptation to another environment. I conducted a survey of published studies of local adaptation to quantify its frequency and magnitude and the costs associated with local adaptation. I also quantified the relationship between local adaptation and environmental differences and the relationship between local adaptation and phenotypic divergence. The overall frequency of local adaptation was 0.71, and the magnitude of the native population advantage in relative fitness was 45{\%}. Divergence between home site environments was positively associated with the magnitude of local adaptation, but phenotypic divergence was not. I found a small negative correlation between a population's relative fitness in its native environment and its fitness in a foreign environment, indicating weak trade-offs associated with local adaptation. These results suggest that populations are often locally adapted but stochastic processes such as genetic drift may limit the efficacy of divergent selection.},

abstract = {Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

abstract = {Hybridization has long been considered a process that prevents divergence between species. In contrast to this historical view, an increasing number of empirical studies claim to show evidence for hybrid speciation without a ploidy change. However, the importance of hybridization as a route to speciation is poorly understood, and many claims have been made with insufficient evidence that hybridization played a role in the speciation process. We propose criteria to determine the strength of evidence for homoploid hybrid speciation. Based on an evaluation of the literature using this framework, we conclude that although hybridization appears to becommon, evidence for an important role of hybridization in homoploid speciation ismore circumscribed.},

Here we refer to these situations as 'relaxed selection,' and review recent studies that explore the effects of such changes on traits in their ecological contexts. In a few systems, such as the loss of armor in stickleback, the genetic, developmental and ecological bases of trait evolution are being discovered. These results yield insights into whether and how fast a trait is reduced or lost under relaxed selection. We provide a prospectus and a framework for understanding relaxed selection and trait loss in natural populations. We also examine its implications for applied issues, such as antibiotic resistance and the success of invasive species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Several theories have provided a framework for understanding variation in plant defence against herbivores. Among them, the plant apparency theory and the resource availability hypothesis (RAH) have aimed to explain the patterns of defence investment and the selective pressures that have led to the variety of defensive strategies across species. Here we provide a historical review of both theories, present evidence that shaped their development and contrast their predictions. 2. We present the results of a meta-analysis of the utility of the RAH 25 years after it was proposed and compare it to apparency theory. We performed a meta-analysis of 50 studies that have examined plant growth, defences and herbivory in relation to resource availability across latitude and ontogeny. Specifically, we tested four predictions that follow the RAH: (i) species adapted to resource-rich environments have intrinsically faster growth rates than species adapted to resource-poor environments; (ii) fast-growing species have shorter leaf lifetimes than slow-growing species; (iii) fast-growing species have lower amounts of constitutive defences than slow-growing species; and (iv) fast-growing species support higher herbivory rates than slow-growing species. 3. Our results confirm the predictions that species adapted to resource-poor environments grow inherently more slowly, invest more in constitutive defences and support lower herbivory than species from more productive habitats. Our data also showed that variation in growth rate among species better explains the differences in herbivory than variation in apparency, suggesting that the evolution of different defensive strategies across species is resource, rather than herbivore driven. We also found that the application of this theory appears robust across latitude and ontogeny, as the magnitude of the effect sizes for most of the predictions did not vary significantly between ecosystems or across ontogenic stages. 4. We conclude that the RAH has served as a valid framework for investigating the patterns of plant defences and that its applicability is quite general.},

Industrial activities, ecological considerations and goals of The Fish Barcode of Life campaign make it crucial that fish species residing in the park be identified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of barcoding data on fishes of the Persian Gulf. We examined 187 individuals representing 76 species, 56 genera and 32 families. The data flagged potentially cryptic species of Gerres filamentosus and Plectorhinchus schotaf. 16S rDNA data on these species are provided. Exclusion of these two potential cryptic species resulted in a mean COI intraspecific distance of 0.18{\%}, and a mean inter- to intraspecific divergence ratio of 66.7. There was no overlap between maximum Kimura 2-parameter distances among conspecifics (1.66{\%}) and minimum distance among congeneric species (6.19{\%}). Barcodes shared among species were not observed. Neighbour-joining analysis showed that most species formed cohesive sequence units with little variation. Finally, the comparison of 16 selected species from this study with meta-data of conspecifics from Australia, India, China and South Africa revealed high interregion divergences and potential existence of six cryptic species. Pairwise interregional comparisons were more informative than global divergence assessments with regard to detection of cryptic variation. Our analysis exemplifies optimal use of the expanding barcode data now becoming available.},

abstract = {Comma butterflies (Nymphalidae: Polygonia c-album L.) from one Belgian site and three Spanish sites were crossed with butterflies from a Swedish population in order to investigate inheritance of female host plant choice, egg mass and larval growth rate. We found three different modes of inheritance for the three investigated traits. In line with earlier results from crosses between Swedish and English populations, the results regarding female oviposition preference (choice between Urtica dioica and Salix caprea) showed X-linked inheritance to be of importance for the variation between Sweden and the other sites. Egg mass and growth rate did not show any sex-linked inheritance. Egg mass differences between populations seem to be controlled mainly by additive autosomal genes, as hybrids showed intermediate values. The growth rates of both hybrid types following reciprocal crossings were similar to each other but consistently higher than for the two source populations, suggesting a nonadditive mode of inheritance which is not sex-linked. The different modes of inheritance for host plant preference vs. important life history traits are likely to result in hybrids with unfit combinations of traits. This type of potential reproductive barrier based on multiple ecologically important traits deserves more attention, as it should be a common situation for instance in the early stages of population divergence in host plant usage, facilitating ecological speciation.},

abstract = {The formation and maintenance of species in nature is accomplished by the evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms. To understand patterns of speciation and coexistence between species, it is crucial to obtain a complete synopsis of reproductive isolating barriers. We identified multiple reproductive isolation barriers between two closely related species, Chorthippus biguttulus and Chorthippus mollis, and quantified their respective contributions to isolation. To this end, we produced hybrids and backcrosses in the laboratory to examine reproductive isolation at multiple stages in the life history. The prezygotic barriers, based on chemical and acoustic cues, are currently the strongest impediments to gene flow between C. biguttulus and C. mollis. This indicates an important role for sexual selection in the maintenance of species isolation. However, extrinsic and intrinsic postzygotic isolation barriers also contributed to reproductive isolation. The virtual sterility of F1 hybrid males was based on both the dysfunctionality of their testes and intermediate behavioral mating traits (behavioral sterility). This study demonstrates that a cascade of reproductive isolating mechanisms reduces the gene flow between C. biguttulus and C. mollis. Our results further demonstrate that the courtship display in these species consists of multimodal signals and indicates a key role of chemical cues in reproductive isolation and speciation in grasshoppers.Significance statementThe identification of species isolating mechanisms is essential for understanding the processes that drive speciation. A profound understanding of reproductive isolating mechanisms and their fitness consequences in a system is required to predict a specific speciation scenario. Members of the grasshopper subfamily Gomphocerinae show an enormous diversity and complexity in courtship behavior, especially in acoustic displays. Here, we demonstrate that non-acoustic and postzygotic isolation mechanisms also strongly contribute to reproductive isolation between the closely related grasshopper species, C. biguttulus and C. mollis. In addition, our results suggest that ongoing gene flow between this species pair is unlikely and that sexual selection plays an important role in the maintenance of species isolation.},

abstract = {Young species are highly prone to extinction via increased gene flow after human-caused environmental changes [1-6]. This mechanism of biodiversity loss, often termed reverse speciation or introgressive extinction, is of exceptional interest because the parent species are typically highly differentiated ecologically. Reverse speciation events are potentially powerful case studies for the role of evolution in driving ecological changes, as the phenotypic shifts associated with introgressive extinction can be large and they occur over particularly short timescales. Furthermore, reverse speciation can lead to novel phenotypes [1, 2], which may in turn produce novel ecological effects. Here we investigate the ecological shift associated with reverse speciation in threespine stickleback fish using a field study and a replicated experiment. We find that an instance of introgressive extinction had cascading ecological consequences that altered the abundance of both aquatic prey and the pupating aquatic insects that emerged into the terrestrial ecosystem. The community and ecosystem impacts of reverse speciation were novel, and yet they were also predictable based on ecological and morphological considerations. The study suggests that knowledge about the community ecology and changes in functional morphology of a dominant species may lead to some predictive power for the ecological effects of evolutionary change. Moreover, the rapid nature and resultant ecological impacts associated with reverse speciation demonstrates the interplay between biodiversity, evolutionary change, and ecosystem function.},

abstract = {The extent to which behavioural choices reflect fine-tuned evolutionary adaptation remains an open debate. For herbivorous insects, the preference-performance hypothesis (PPH) states that female insects will evolve to oviposit on hosts on which their offspring fare best. In this study, we use meta-analysis to assess the balance of evidence for and against the PPH, and to evaluate the role of individual factors proposed to influence host selection by female insects. We do so in an explicitly bitrophic context (herbivores versus plants). Overall, our analyses offer clear support for the PPH: Offspring survive better on preferred plant types, and females lay more eggs on plant types conducive to offspring performance. We also found evidence for an effect of diet breadth on host choice: female preference for 'good quality plants' was stronger in oligophagous insects than in polyphagous insects. Nonetheless, despite the large numbers of preference-performance studies conducted to date, sample sizes in our meta-analysis are low due to the inconsistent format used by authors to present their results. To improve the situation, we invite authors to contribute to the data base emerging from this work, with the aim of reaching a strengthened synthesis of the subject field.},

The cytochrome c oxidase 1 sequence, which has been found to be widely applicable in animal barcoding, is not appropriate for most species of plants because of a much slower rate of cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene evolution in higher plants than in animals. We therefore propose the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region and the plastid trnH-psbA intergenic spacer as potentially usable DNA regions for applying barcoding to flowering plants. The internal transcribed spacer is the most commonly sequenced locus used in plant phylogenetic investigations at the species level and shows high levels of interspecific divergence. The trnH-psbA spacer, although short ( approximately 450-bp), is the most variable plastid region in angiosperms and is easily amplified across a broad range of land plants. Comparison of the total plastid genomes of tobacco and deadly nightshade enhanced with trials on widely divergent angiosperm taxa, including closely related species in seven plant families and a group of species sampled from a local flora encompassing 50 plant families (for a total of 99 species, 80 genera, and 53 families), suggest that the sequences in this pair of loci have the potential to discriminate among the largest number of plant species for barcoding purposes.},

Assessing the frequency and dynamics of interspecific hybridization is therefore of paramount importance for conservation purposes. Here we investigate, using DNA flow cytometry, multivariate morphometrics and chloroplast DNA sequencing, the frequency and direction of interspecific hybridization between the critically endangered Czech endemic psammophyte Dianthus arenarius subsp. bohemicus and its sympatric congener D. carthusianorum (Caryophyllaceae) in a single population in central Bohemia. Flow cytometry allowed unambiguous identification of both parental species, based on differences in the amounts of nuclear DNA and revealed a few individuals ({\textless} 1.1{\%} of the samples analysed) with intermediate genome sizes that corresponded to F1 hybrids. Clear discontinuities in estimated genome sizes and a low variation within recognized taxonomic groups make backcrossing to parental species or introgression unlikely. Interspecific hybrids were considerably less fertile, producing largely aborted pollen grains and no seed. Analysis of chloroplast haplotypes provided evidence for reciprocal hybridization (both species served as maternal and paternal parents). Length of the lowermost pair of cauline leaves, calyx length and petal length (incl. separate lengths of petal claw and petal limb) were taxonomically the most informative characters, allowing reliable identification of both parental species and their hybrids. The results indicate that interspecific hybridization has only a minor effect on the genetic integrity of the endemic D. arenarius subsp. bohemicus in its last remaining natural population. Nonetheless, we recommend periodic monitoring especially as the recent controlled large-scale disturbances (mechanical removal of the vegetation cover) in the locality may promote the establishment of interspecific crosses.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: •

PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Polyploidization is a key factor involved in the diversification of plants. Although polyploids are commonly found, there remains controversy on the mechanisms that lead to their successful establishment. One major problem that has been identified is that newly formed polyploids lack mates of the appropriate ploidy level and may experience severely reduced fertility due to nonproductive intercytotype crosses. Niche differentiation has been proposed as a primary mechanism that can alleviate this reproductive disadvantage and facilitate polyploid establishment. Here we test whether the establishment of tetraploid cytotypes of Heuchera cylindrica (Saxifragaceae) is consistent with climatic niche differentiation. •

METHODS: We use a combination of field surveys, flow cytometry and species distribution models to: (1) examine the distribution of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes; and (2) determine whether tetraploid Heuchera cylindrica occupy climates that differ from those of its diploid progenitors. •

KEY RESULTS: The geographic distributions of diploid and tetraploid cytotypes are largely allopatric as an extensive survey of 636 plants from 43 locations failed to detect any populations with both cytotypes. Although diploids and tetraploids occur in different geographic areas, polyploid Heuchera cylindrica occur almost exclusively in environments that are predicted to be suitable to diploid populations. •

CONCLUSIONS: Climatic niche differentiation does not explain the geographic distribution of tetraploid Heuchera cylindrica. We propose instead that tetraploid lineages were able to establish by taking advantage of glacial retreat and expanding into previously unoccupied sites.},

In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used for their identification in population genomic data.

abstract = {Polyploidy is widely acknowledged as a major mechanism of adaptation and speciation in plants. The stages in polyploid evolution include frequent fertility bottlenecks and infrequent events such as gametic nonreduction and interspecific hybridization, yet little is known about how these and other factors influence overall rates of polyploid formation. Here we review the literature regarding polyploid origins, and quantify parameter values for each of the steps involved in the principal pathways. In contrast to the common claim that triploids are sterile, our results indicate that the triploid bridge pathway can contribute significantly to autopolyploid formation regardless of the mating system, and to allopolyploid formation in outcrossing taxa. We estimate that the total rate of autotetraploid formation is of the same order as the genic mutation rate (1 O-5), and that a high frequency of interspecific hybridization (0.2{\%} for selfing taxa, 2.7{\%} for outcrossing taxa) is required for the rate of tetraploid formation via allopolyploidy to equal that by autopolyploidy. We conclude that the rate of autopolyploid formation may often be higher than the rate of allopolyploid formation. Further progress toward understanding polyploid origins requires studies in natural populations that quantify: (a) the frequency of unredluced gametes, (b) the effectiveness of triploid bridge pathways, and (c) the rates of interspecific hybridization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most tropical and subtropical plants are biotically pollinated, and insects are the major pollinators. A small but ecologically and economically important group of plants classified in 28 orders, 67 families and about 528 species of angiosperms are pollinated by nectar-feeding bats. From a phylogenetic perspective this is a derived pollination mode involving a relatively large and energetically expensive pollinator. Here its ecological and evolutionary consequences are explored. SCOPE AND CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes adaptations in bats and plants that facilitate this interaction and discusses the evolution of bat pollination from a plant phylogenetic perspective. Two families of bats contain specialized flower visitors, one in the Old World and one in the New World. Adaptation to pollination by bats has evolved independently many times from a variety of ancestral conditions, including insect-, bird- and non-volant mammal-pollination. Bat pollination predominates in very few families but is relatively common in certain angiosperm subfamilies and tribes. We propose that flower-visiting bats provide two important benefits to plants: they deposit large amounts of pollen and a variety of pollen genotypes on plant stigmas and, compared with many other pollinators, they are long-distance pollen dispersers. Bat pollination tends to occur in plants that occur in low densities and in lineages producing large flowers. In highly fragmented tropical habitats, nectar bats play an important role in maintaining the genetic continuity of plant populations and thus have considerable conservation value.},

abstract = {The functional/phylogenetic relationship between the angiosperm flower and insects, combined with the correlation between insect pollination and many of the most diverse angiosperm families, suggest that insect pollination has had an important role in angiosperm success. Various advantages of insect pollination at the species level, especially those associated with bee and lepidopteran pollinators, are consistent with these correlations-furthermore, modem angiosperm diversity may be more directly related to insect pollination by the speciation-promoting characteristics of constant pollinators. Until the present time, paleontological data have mitigated against this possibility by illustrating that both advanced insect pollinators and their co-adapted angiosperm flowers evolved too late to have been of major significance in angiosperm radiation. Recent analyses of paleobotanical and biogeographical data together with paleobotanical data indicate that hymenopteran and lepidopteran pollinators, and angiosperm taxa having flowers adapted to them, existed at a time of major angiosperm radiation. Although angiosperm success cannot be confidently related to one feature, the importance of insect pollination in the diversification of the group can no longer be minimized in the context of the fossil record. Angiosperms are distinguished among the tracheophyta by their overwhelming diversity [250/ 300 families of vascular plants are angiosperms; 240,000/300,000 species of flowering plants are angiosperms (Burger, 1981)]. The angiosperms are also dominant in sheer numbers of individuals and are of extraordinary economic importance. Furthermore, angiosperms demonstrate stunning variation in vegetative and reproductive morphology, anatomy, and habit.},

Historically, work has focused on the influence of parents on offspring but recent advances have extended this perspective to interactions among other relatives and even unrelated individuals. IGEs lead to complicated pathways of inheritance, where environmental sources of variation can be transmitted across generations and therefore contribute to evolutionary change. The existence of IGEs alters the genotype-phenotype relationship, changing the evolutionary process in some dramatic and non-intuitive ways.},

abstract = {Ecological speciation occurs when reproductive isolation evolves ultimately as a result of divergent natural selection between populations inhabiting different environments or exploiting alternative resources. I tested a prediction of the ecological model concerning the fitness of hybrids between two young, sympatric species of threespine sticklebacks (Benthics and Limnetics). The two species are ecologically and morphologically divergent: the Benthic is adapted to feeding on invertebrates in the littoral zone of the lake whereas the Limnetic is adapted to feeding on zooplankton in the open water. The growth rate of two types of hybrids, the Benthic backcross and the Limnetic backcross, as well as both parent species, was evaluated in enclosures in both parental habitats in the lake. The use of backcrosses is ideal because a comparison of their growth rates in the two habitats estimates an ecologically dependent component of their fitness while controlling for any intrinsic genetic incompatibilities that may exist between the Benthic and Limnetic genomes. The backcross results revealed a striking pattern of ecological dependence: in the littoral zone, Benthic backcrosses grew at approximately twice the rate of Limnetic backcrosses, while in the open water, Limnetic backcrosses grew at approximately twice the rate of Benthic backcrosses. Such a reversal of relative fitness of the two cross-types in the two environments provides strong evidence that divergent natural selection has played a central role in the evolution of postmating isolation between Benthics and Limnetics. Although the rank order of growth rates of all cross-types in the littoral zone was Benthic {\textgreater} Benthic backcross {\textgreater} Limnetic backcross {\textgreater} Limnetic, neither backcross differed significantly from the parent from which it was mainly derived. Implications of this result are discussed in terms of ecological speciation and possible introgressive hybridization between the species. Results in the open water were less clear and were not fully consistent with the ecological model of speciation, mainly as a result of the low growth rate of Limnetics. However, analysis of the diet of the fish in the open water suggests that these enclosures may not have been fully successful at replicating the food regimes characteristic of this habitat.},

abstract = {Plant responses to herbivory and light competition are often in opposing directions, posing a potential conflict for plants experiencing both stresses. For sun-adapted species, growing in shade typically makes plants more constitutively susceptible to herbivores via reduced structural and chemical resistance traits. Nonetheless, the impact of light environment on induced resistance has been less well-studied, especially in field experiments that link physiological mechanisms to ecological outcomes. Accordingly, we studied induced resistance of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca, a sun-adapted plant), and linked hormonal responses, resistance traits, and performance of specialist monarch caterpillars (Danaus plexippus) in varying light environments. In natural populations, plants growing under forest-edge shade showed reduced levels of resistance traits (lower leaf toughness, cardenolides, and trichomes) and enhanced light-capture traits (higher specific leaf area, larger leaves, and lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratio) compared to paired plants in full sun. In a field experiment repeated over two years, only milkweeds growing in full sun exhibited induced resistance to monarchs, whereas plants growing in shade were constitutively more susceptible and did not induce resistance. In a more controlled field experiment, plant hormones were higher in the sun (jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, abscisic acid, indole acidic acid) and were induced by herbivory (jasmonic acid and abscisic acid). In particular, the jasmonate burst following herbivory was halved in plants raised in shaded habitats, and this correspondingly reduced latex induction (but not cardenolide induction). Thus, we provide a mechanistic basis for the attenuation of induced plant resistance in low resource environments. Additionally, there appears to be specificity in these interactions, with light-mediated impacts on jasmonate-induction being stronger for latex exudation than cardenolides.},

abstract = {The genetic architecture of floral traits involved in the evolution of self-pollination provides a window into past processes of mating system divergence. In this study, we use two generations of crosses between highly selfing and predominantly outcrossing populations of Arenaria uniflora (Caryophyllaceae) to determine the minimum number, average dominance relationships, and pleiotropic effects of genetic factors involved in floral divergence. Comparison of the F1 and F2 phenotypic means with the expectations of a completely additive model of gene action revealed a primarily additive genetic basis for floral characters associated with mating system variation. The exception was flower life span, which showed partial dominance of the outcrosser phenology. In contrast to similarly divergent species, the substantial differences in flower size between these A. uniflora populations appear to involve relatively few genes of large effect (minimum number of effective factors = 2.2 +/- 2.8 SE). In addition, correlations among traits in the F2 generation indicate that pleiotropy may be an important feature of the genetic architecture of floral evolution in A. uniflora. The evolution of selfing via major modifiers of floral morphology is consistent with other evidence for ecological selection for preemptive self-pollination in A. uniflora. Analyses of the genetic basis of autonomous selfing were complicated by hybrid breakdown in both F1 and F2 generations. Only F1 hybrids showed reductions in female fertility, but about 30{\%} of F1 and F2 hybrids exhibited partial or complete male sterility. Male sterile flowers were characterized by short stamens, reduced petals, and a lack of protandry, as well as indehiscent anthers. This morphological breakdown mimics environmental disruptions of floral development and may result from novel genic interactions in hybrids.},

abstract = {As a result of the process of descent with modification, closely related species tend to be similar to one another in a myriad different ways. In statistical terms, this means that traits measured on one species will not be independent of traits measured on others. Since their introduction in the 1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been framed as a solution to this problem. In this paper, we argue that this way of thinking about PCMs is deeply misleading. Not only has this sowed widespread confusion in the literature about what PCMs are doing but has led us to develop methods that are susceptible to the very thing we sought to build defenses against $\backslash$---| unreplicated evolutionary events. Through three Case Studies, we demonstrate that the susceptibility to singular events indeed a recurring problem in comparative biology that links several seemingly unrelated controversies. In each Case Study we propose a potential solution to the problem. While the details of our proposed solutions differ, they share a common theme: unifying hypothesis testing with data-driven approaches (which we term "phylogenetic natural history") to disentangle the impact of singular evolutionary events from that of the factors we are investigating. More broadly, we argue that our field has, at times, been sloppy when weighing evidence in support of causal hypotheses. We suggest that one way to refine our inferences is to re-imagine phylogenies as probabilistic graphical models; adopting this way of thinking will help clarify precisely what we are testing and what evidence supports our claims.},

abstract = {The fitness effects of mutations on a given genotype are rarely constant across environments to which this genotype is more or less adapted, that is, between more or less stressful conditions. This can have important implications, especially on the evolution of ecological specialization. Stress is thought to increase the variance of mutations' fitness effects, their average, or the number of expressed mutations. Although empirical evidence is available for these three mechanisms, their relative magnitude is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to discriminate between these mechanisms, using a survey of empirical measures of mutation effects in contrasted environments. This survey, across various species and environments, shows that stress mainly increases the variance of mutations' effects on fitness, with a much more limited impact on their average effect or on the number of expressed mutations. This pattern is consistent with a simple model in which fitness is a Gaussian function of phenotypes around an environ-mentally determined optimum. These results suggest that a simple, mathematically tractable landscape model may not be quantitatively as unrealistic as previously suggested. They also suggest that mutation parameter estimates may be strongly biased when measured in stressful environments. Spontaneous mutation is the ultimate source of variation and influences the evolutionary fate of a wide range of phe-nomena (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1998; Lynch et al. 1999). More specifically, the evolutionary role of mutation depends on the genomic mutation rate, U, and the distribution of mutations' fitness effects, f (s). In principle, U and f (s) may vary among genotypes within species, among species, and among environments, which may obscure both the interpre-tation of empirical measurements and theoretical predictions. However, we still have little insights into how U and f (s) may vary in general. In a recent paper (Martin and Lenormand 2006), we showed that f (s) may vary in a predictable way between more or less complex organisms. In this paper, we focus on the variation of mutation effects in different envi-ronments. Since the work of Kondrashov and Houle (1994), several studies have documented differences in mutation effects across various environments for quantitative traits that are more or less related to fitness (reviewed in Lynch et al.},

abstract = {Recent excitement over the development of an initiative to generate DNA sequences for all named species on the planet has in our opinion generated two major areas of contention as to how this 'DNA barcoding' initiative should proceed. It is critical that these two issues are clarified and resolved, before the use of DNA as a tool for taxonomy and species delimitation can be universalized. The first issue concerns how DNA data are to be used in the context of this initiative; this is the DNA barcode reader problem (or barcoder problem). Currently, many of the published studies under this initiative have used tree building methods and more precisely distance approaches to the construction of the trees that are used to place certain DNA sequences into a taxonomic context. The second problem involves the reaction of the taxonomic community to the directives of the 'DNA barcoding' initiative. This issue is extremely important in that the classical taxonomic approach and the DNA approach will need to be reconciled in order for the 'DNA barcoding' initiative to proceed with any kind of community acceptance. In fact, we feel that DNA barcoding is a misnomer. Our preference is for the title of the London meetings--Barcoding Life. In this paper we discuss these two concerns generated around the DNA barcoding initiative and attempt to present a phylogenetic systematic framework for an improved barcoder as well as a taxonomic framework for interweaving classical taxonomy with the goals of 'DNA barcoding'.},

This article examines morphological , chemical. and molecular character expression in hybrids to determine whether traditionally recognized properties of hybrid plants , such as hybrid intermediacy and character coherence. are actually supported by empirical evidence. and also examines the impact of hybrids on phylogenetic analyses. We show that hybrids are a mosaic of both parental and intermediate morphological characters rather than just intermediate ones. and that a large proportion of first (64{\%}) and later generation hybrids (897"-) exhibit extreme or novel characters. Chemical character expression in hybrids is more predictable. with predominantly additive or complementary expression for both first generation hybrids (68o/c) and hybrid taxa (549c). Likewise. the genetic basis. and thus the expression of molecular characters. is well:worked out and predictable. although non-Mendelian inheritance has been reported in a few instances for molecular markers as well. There is even less empirical support for the concept of character coherence than hybrid intennediacy. Although morphological character coherence has been reported in both artificial and natural hybrid populations. it appears to be the exception rather than the rule. This idiosyncratic relationship among morphological characters is shown to be the norm for the relationship of morphological to molecular characters, as well as for the relationship among: molecular characters . Hybrids are shown to have little impact on the topology of nonhybrid tax.a in phylogenetic trees . However. the expression of primitive vs. derived character states. the placement of hybrids in cladograrns. the number of equally parsimonious trees produced. and the effects of hybrids on phylogenetic topology do not appear to be predictable.

abstract = {Background and Aims ‘Pollination syndromes' are suites of phenotypic traits hypothesized to reflect convergent adaptations of flowers for pollination by specific types of animals. They were first developed in the 1870s and honed during the mid 20th Century. In spite of this long history and their central role in organizing research on plant–pollinator interactions, the pollination syndromes have rarely been subjected to test. The syndromes were tested here by asking whether they successfully capture patterns of covariance of floral traits and predict the most common pollinators of flowers.Methods Flowers in six communities from three continents were scored for expression of floral traits used in published descriptions of the pollination syndromes, and simultaneously the pollinators of as many species as possible were characterized.Key Results Ordination of flowers in a multivariate ‘phenotype space' defined by the syndromes showed that almost no plant species fall within the discrete syndrome clusters. Furthermore, in approximately two-thirds of plant species, the most common pollinator could not be successfully predicted by assuming that each plant species belongs to the syndrome closest to it in phenotype space.Conclusions The pollination syndrome hypothesis as usually articulated does not successfully describe the diversity of floral phenotypes or predict the pollinators of most plant species. Caution is suggested when using pollination syndromes for organizing floral diversity, or for inferring agents of floral adaptation. A fresh look at how traits of flowers and pollinators relate to visitation and pollen transfer is recommended, in order to determine whether axes can be identified that describe floral functional diversity more successfully than the traditional syndromes.},

This difference may be largely due to the propensity of angiosperms to undergo chromosomal duplication ('polyploidization') and subsequent gene loss ('diploidization'); these evolutionary mechanisms have profound consequences for comparative biology. Here we integrate a phylogenetic approach (relating chromosomal duplications to the tree of life) with a genomic approach (mitigating information lost to diploidization) to show that a genome-wide duplication post-dates the divergence of Arabidopsis from most dicots. We also show that an inferred ancestral gene order for Arabidopsis reveals more synteny with other dicots (exemplified by cotton), and that additional, more ancient duplication events affect more distant taxonomic comparisons. By using partial sequence data for many diverse taxa to better relate the evolutionary history of completely sequenced genomes to the tree of life, we foster comparative approaches to the study of genome organization, consequences of polyploidy, and the molecular basis of quantitative traits.},

abstract = {The flora of the Hawaiian Islands is widely recognized for its spectacular adaptive radiations, yet factors maintaining or reinforcing the evolutionary divergence associated with radiation have been little studied. In the Hawaiian Islands, Sida fallax occurs as two genetically distinct forms, a beach ecotype, which grows as a prostrate shrub with small, pubescent leaves, and a mountain ecotype, which grows as an erect shrub with larger, nearly glabrous leaves. Plants with intermediate morphology have only occasionally been reported. We made experimental crosses between the beach and mountain forms to test for fertility barriers and to assess the morphology and fitness of hybrids. Among beach‐mountain crosses, average fruit set (83{\%}) and germination (80{\%}) were not statistically different from intra‐ecotype crosses. Furthermore, pollen stainability among beach‐mountain hybrids (96{\%}) was also not significantly lower than in intra‐ecotype crosses, indicating a lack of fertility barriers. Among eight traits that differed statistically between beach and mountain ecotypes, four (50{\%}) were intermediate in the hybrids, three (37.5{\%}) showed affinity toward one parental type, and one (12.5{\%}) was extreme. The survival and growth rate of beach‐mountain hybrids did not differ from intra‐ecotype crosses under well‐watered or drought greenhouse conditions; however, the beach ecotype had a higher flowering frequency under drought conditions in comparison with the hybrids and the mountain ecotype. In the field, low water availability in the beach environment probably selects against hybrids, reinforcing differentiation between beach and mountain ecotypes. Furthermore, human land use has reduced intermediate habitats, decreasing opportunities for natural hybridization. CR  - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2006 The University of Chicago Press},

abstract = {Forests and woodlands are under continuing pressure from urban and agricultural development. Tree-dependent mammals that rarely venture to the ground are likely to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. The Australian squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) provides an excellent case study to examine genetic (functional) connectivity among populations. It has an extensive range that occurs in a wide band along the east coast. However, its forest and woodland habitat has become greatly reduced in area and is severely fragmented within the southern inland part of the species' range, where it is recognised as threatened. Within central and northern coastal regions, habitat is much more intact and we thus hypothesise that genetic connectivity will be greater in this region than in the south. To test this we employed microsatellite analysis in a molecular population biology approach. Most sampling locations in the highly modified south showed signatures of genetic isolation. In contrast, a high level of genetic connectivity was inferred among most sampled populations in the more intact habitat of the coastal region, with samples collected 1400 km apart having similar genetic cluster membership. Nonetheless, some coastal populations associated with urbanisation and agriculture are genetically isolated, suggesting the historic pattern observed in the south is emerging on the coast. Our study demonstrates that massive landscape changes following European settlement have had substantial impacts on levels of connectivity among squirrel glider populations, as predicted on the basis of the species' ecology. This suggests that landscape planning and management in the south should be focused on restoring habitat connectivity where feasible, while along the coast, existing habitat connectivity must be maintained and recent losses restored. Molecular population biology approaches provide a ready means for identifying fragmentation effects on a species at multiple scales. Such studies are required to examine the generality of our findings for other tree-dependent species.},

State-3 oxygen consumption and CcOX activity were studied in rat N27 mesencephalic cells to examine the functional interaction of cyanide and nitric oxide (NO). KCN produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of cellular respiration. Cyanide's median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of oxygen consumption (13.2 +/- 1.8microM) was higher than the CcOX IC50 (7.2 +/- 0.1microM). Based on respiratory threshold analysis, 60{\%} inhibition of CcOX was necessary before oxygen consumption was decreased. Addition of high levels of exogenous NO (100microM S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine) attenuated cyanide inhibition of both respiration and CcOX. On the other hand, when endogenous NO generation was blocked by an NOS inhibitor (N(omega)-monomethyl-L-arginine ester), the cyanide IC50 for both respiration and CcOX increased to 59.6 +/- 0.9microM and 102 +/- 10microM, respectively, thus showing constitutive, low-level NO production enhanced cyanide inhibition. Laser scanning cytometry showed that cyanide elevated mitochondrial NO, which then was available to interact with CcOX to enhance the inhibition. It is concluded that the rapid, potent action of cyanide is due in part to mitochondrial generation of NO, which enhances inhibition of CcOX. At low mitochondrial oxygen tensions, the cyanide-NO interaction would be increased. Also, the antidotal action of sodium nitrite is partly explained by generation of high mitochondrial levels of NO, which antagonizes the CcOX inhibition.},

abstract = {A central topic for conservation science is evaluating how human activities influence global species diversity. Humanity exacerbates extinction rates. But by what mechanisms does humanity drive the emergence of new species? We review human-mediated speciation, compare speciation and known extinctions, and discuss the challenges of using net species diversity as a conservation objective. Humans drive rapid evolution through relocation, domestication, hunting and novel ecosystem creation—and emerging technol-ogies could eventually provide additional mechanisms. The number of species relocated, domesticated and hunted during the Holocene is of comparable magnitude to the number of observed extinctions. While instances of human-mediated speciation are known, the overall effect these mechanisms have upon speciation rates has not yet been quantified. We also explore the importance of anthropogenic influence upon divergence in microorganisms. Even if human activities resulted in no net loss of species diversity by balan-cing speciation and extinction rates, this would probably be deemed unacceptable. We discuss why, based upon 'no net loss' conservation litera-ture—considering phylogenetic diversity and other metrics, risk aversion, taboo trade-offs and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that evaluating spe-ciation alongside extinction could result in more nuanced understanding of biosphere trends, clarifying what it is we actually value about biodiversity.},

abstract = {Understanding of the determinants of species' geographic range limits remains poorly integrated. In part, this is because of the diversity of perspectives on the issue, and because empirical studies have lagged substantially behind developments in theory. Here, I provide a broad overview, drawing together many of the disparate threads, considering, in turn, how influences on the terms of a simple single-population equation can determine range limits. There is theoretical and empirical evidence for systematic changes towards range limits under some circumstances in each of the demographic parameters. However, under other circumstances, no such changes may take place in particular parameters, or they may occur in a different direction, with limitation still occurring. This suggests that (i) little about range limitation can categorically be inferred from many empirical studies, which document change in only one demographic parameter, (ii) there is a need for studies that document variation in all of the parameters, and (iii) in agreement with theoretical evidence that range limits can be formed in the presence or absence of hard boundaries, environmental gradients or biotic interactions, there may be few general patterns as to the determinants of these limits, with most claimed generalities at least having many exceptions.},

abstract = {Hybrid viability decreases with divergence time, a pattern consistent with a so-called speciation clock. However, the actual rate at which this clock ticks is poorly known. Most speciation-clock studies have used genetic divergence as a proxy for time, adopting a molecular clock and often far-distant calibration points to convert genetic distances into age. Because molecular clock assumptions are violated for most genetic datasets and distant calibrations are of questionable utility, the actual rate at which reproductive isolation evolves may be substantially different than current estimates suggest. We provide a robust measure of the tempo at which hybrid viability declines with divergence time in a clade of freshwater fishes (Centrarchidae). This incompatibility clock is distinct from a speciation clock because speciation events in centrarchids appear to be driven largely by prezygotic isolation. Our analyses used divergence times estimated with penalized likelihood applied to a phylogeny derived from seven gene regions and calibrated with six centrarchid fossils. We found that hybrid embryo viability declined at mean rate of 3.13{\%} per million years, slower than in most other taxa investigated to date. Despite measurement error in both molecular estimated ages and hatching success of hybrid crosses, divergence time explained between 73{\%} and 90{\%} of the variation in hybrid viability among nodes. This high correlation is consistent with the gradual accumulation of many genetic incompatibilities of small effect. Hybrid viability declined with the square of time, consistent with an increasing rate of accumulation of incompatibilities between divergent genomes (the snowball effect). However, the quadratic slope is due to a lag phase resulting from heterosis among young species pairs, a phenomenon rarely considered in predictions of hybrid fitness. Finally, we found that reciprocal crosses often show asymmetrical hybrid viabilities. We discuss several alternative explanations for this result including possible deleterious cytonuclear interactions. Speciation-clock studies have been a small cottage industry recently, but there are still novel insights to be gained from analyses of more taxonomic groups. However, between-group comparisons require more careful molecular-clock calibration than has been the norm.},

abstract = {Animal pigment patterns are important for a range of functions, including camouflage and communication. Repeating pigment patterns, such as stripes, bars and spots have been of particular interest to developmental and theoretical biologists, but the genetic basis of natural variation in such patterns is largely unexplored. In this study, we identify a difference in a periodic pigment pattern among juvenile threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from different environments. Freshwater sticklebacks exhibit prominent vertical bars that visually break up the body shape, but sticklebacks from marine populations do not. We hypothesize that these distinct pigment patterns are tuned to provide crypsis in different habitats. This phenotypic difference is widespread and appears in most of the freshwater populations that we sampled. We used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in freshwater-marine F2 hybrids to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying divergence in this pigmentation pattern. We identified two QTL that were significantly associated with variation in barring. Interestingly, these QTL were associated with two distinct aspects of the pigment pattern: melanophore number and overall pigment level. We compared the QTL locations with positions of known pigment candidate genes in the stickleback genome. We also identified two major QTL for juvenile body size, providing new insights into the genetic basis of juvenile growth rates in natural populations. In summary, although there is a growing literature describing simple genetic bases for adaptive coloration differences, this study emphasizes that pigment patterns can also possess a more complex genetic architecture.

These classical explanations have, however, failed to explain variation in the magnitude of local adaptation observed across taxa.

First, we develop and analyse mathematical models that predict levels of local adaptationwill increasewith the number of traits experi- encing spatially variable selection. Next, we test this prediction by estimating the relationship between dimensionality and local adaptation using data from 35 published reciprocal transplant studies. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between dimensionality and degree of local adaptation, and thus provides empirical support for the predictions of our model.},

abstract = {As a result of the process of descent with modification, closely related species tend to be similar to one another in a myriad different ways. In statistical terms, this means that traits measured on one species will not be independent of traits measured on others. Since their introduction in the 1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been framed as a solution to this problem. In this paper, we argue that this way of thinking about PCMs is deeply misleading. Not only has this sowed widespread confusion in the literature about what PCMs are doing but has led us to develop methods that are susceptible to the very thing we sought to build defenses against $\backslash$---| unreplicated evolutionary events. Through three Case Studies, we demonstrate that the susceptibility to singular events indeed a recurring problem in comparative biology that links several seemingly unrelated controversies. In each Case Study we propose a potential solution to the problem. While the details of our proposed solutions differ, they share a common theme: unifying hypothesis testing with data-driven approaches (which we term "phylogenetic natural history") to disentangle the impact of singular evolutionary events from that of the factors we are investigating. More broadly, we argue that our field has, at times, been sloppy when weighing evidence in support of causal hypotheses. We suggest that one way to refine our inferences is to re-imagine phylogenies as probabilistic graphical models; adopting this way of thinking will help clarify precisely what we are testing and what evidence supports our claims.},

abstract = {Plant interactions with mutualists and antagonists vary remarkably across space, and have played key roles in the ecology and evolution of flowering plants. One dominant form of spatial variation is human modification of the landscape, including urbanization and suburbanization. Our goal was to assess how suburbanization affected plant-animal interactions in Gelsemium sempervirens in the southeastern United States, including interactions with mutualists (pollination) and antagonists (nectar robbing and florivory). Based on differences in plant-animal interactions measured in multiple replicate sites, we then developed predictions for how these differences would affect patterns of natural selection, and we explored the patterns using measurements of floral and defensive traits in the field and in a common garden. We found that Gelsemium growing in suburban sites experienced more robbing and florivory as well as more heterospecific but not conspecific pollen transfer. Floral traits, particularly corolla length and width, influenced the susceptibility of plants to particular interactors. Observational data of floral traits measured in the field and in a common garden provided some supporting but also some conflicting evidence for the hypothesis that floral traits evolved in response to differences in species interactions in suburban vs. wild sites. However, the degree to which plants can respond to any one interactor may be constrained by correlations among floral morphological traits. Taken together, consideration of the broader geographic context in which organisms interact, in both suburban and wild areas, is fundamental to our understanding of the forces that shape contemporary plant-animal interactions and selection pressures in native species.},

The latter was calculated as the number of gene copies present in the population after more than two generations, as estimated by tracing genetic lineages and accounting for the fact that populations were not completely closed. When counting fledglings, rate-insensitive estimates of individual fitness correlated better than rate-sensitive estimates with estimated long-term genetic contribution. When counting recruits, both classes of estimates performed equally well. The results support the contention that simple, rate-insensitive measures of fitness, such as LRS, provide a valid and good estimate of fitness in evolutionary studies of natural populations.},

We report evidence of genetic variability in maturation thresholds for male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that mature either as large (more than 1 kg) anadromous males or as small (10–150 g) parr. Using a common-garden experimental protocol, we find that the growth rate at which the sneaker parr phenotype is expressed differs among pure- and mixed-population crosses. Maturation thresholds of hybrids were intermediate to those of pure crosses, consistent with the hypothesis that the life-history switch points are heritable. Our work provides evidence, for a vertebrate, that thresholds for alternative reproductive tactics differ genetically among populations and can be modelled as discontinuous reaction norms for age and size at maturity.},

The mechanisms underlying mate choice can, therefore, determine whether hybridization promotes or retards speciation. Further, the nature of the processes underlyingmating decitions imposes important constraints on their roles as agents of selection. Understanind the evolutionary genetics of hybridization requires a more detailed consideration of what determines mating interactions among individuals. For hybridization to have notable evolutionary consequences, two things have to happen: first, matings have to occur between males and females from divergent populations and second, hybrids have to mate with each other and/or backcross to parentals. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that behavioural barriers to interspecific mating are brittle and susceptible to environmental perturbation. Once hybridization occurs, novel suites of signals and novel suites of preferences can facilitate backcrossing to parentals or, alternatively, can lead to hybrid speciation. I will discuss each of these in turn.},

abstract = {Epigenetic modifications have effects on phenotype, but they are generally considered to be cleared on passage through the germ line in mammals, so that only genetic traits are inherited. Here we describe the inheritance of an epigenetic modification at the agouti locus in mice. In viable yellow ( A(vy)/a) mice, transcription originating in an intra-cisternal A particle (IAP) retrotransposon inserted upstream of the agouti gene (A) causes ectopic expression of agouti protein, resulting in yellow fur, obesity, diabetes and increased susceptibility to tumours. The pleiotropic effects of ectopic agouti expression are presumably due to effects of the paracrine signal on other tissues. Avy mice display variable expressivity because they are epigenetic mosaics for activity of the retrotransposon: isogenic Avy mice have coats that vary in a continuous spectrum from full yellow, through variegated yellow/agouti, to full agouti (pseudoagouti). The distribution of phenotypes among offspring is related to the phenotype of the dam; when an A(vy) dam has the agouti phenotype, her offspring are more likely to be agouti. We demonstrate here that this maternal epigenetic effect is not the result of a maternally contributed environment. Rather, our data show that it results from incomplete erasure of an epigenetic modification when a silenced Avy allele is passed through the female germ line, with consequent inheritance of the epigenetic modification. Because retrotransposons are abundant in mammalian genomes, this type of inheritance may be common.},

We provide the first direct test of this hypothesis, using light-level geolocators to track birds breeding in a hybrid zone between Swainson's thrushes in western Canada. Compared to parental forms, hybrids exhibited increased variability in their migratory routes, with some using intermediate routes that crossed arid and mountainous regions, and some using the same routes as one parental group on fall migration and the other on spring migration. Hybrids also tended to use geographically intermediate wintering sites. Analysis of genetic variation across the hybrid zone suggests moderately strong selection against hybrids. These results indicate that seasonal migratory behaviour might be a source of selection against hybrids, supporting a possible role for migration in speciation.},

In this study, we exploited three levels of water depths and two types of sediments to investigate the resource allocation pattern of the first generation of the natural hybrid Potamogeton ×intortifolius compared to its parents P. wrightii and P. perfoliatus. We also measured the ramet survivorship and the seed set of the hybrid P. ×intortifolius. Our results showed that P. ×intortifolius had higher ramet survival than its parents at 1.5-m water depth on clay sediment. The possible tradeoffs showed that in P. ×intortifolius the tradeoff pattern between sexual and clonal reproduction was more pronounced in limiting environments. The individuals allocated more resources to sexual reproduction when the environment was limiting, which might confer a higher ability to utilize resources, to produce offspring and to found new populations. Although the seed set of P. ×intortifolius was lower than its parents, it had a higher ability to increase its seed set when the environment was limiting (sandy sediment) than its parents, which might benefit its future survival.

This conceptually simple model is capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range limits for many species. We analyzed how the realized climate space of current ecosystems changes in extent, elevation, and spatial distribution under climate change scenarios and evaluated the implications for potential tree species habitat. Tree species with their northern range limit in British Columbia gain potential habitat at a pace of at least 100 km per decade, common hardwoods appear to be generally unaffected by climate change, and some of the most important conifer species in British Columbia are expected to lose a large portion of their suitable habitat. The extent of spatial redistribution of realized climate space for ecosystems is considerable, with currently important sub-boreal and montane climate regions rapidly disappearing. Local predictions of changes to tree species frequencies were generated as a basis for systematic surveys of biological response to climate change.},

abstract = {Here, the coevolution of mycorrhizal fungi and roots is assessed in the light of evidence now available, from palaeobotanical and morphological studies and the analysis of DNA-based phylogenies. The first bryophyte-like land plants, in the early Devonian (400 million years ago), had enclophytic associations resembling vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas (VAM) even before roots evolved. Mycorrhizal evolution would have progressed from enclophytic hyphae towards balanced associations where partners were interdependent due to the exchange of limiting energy and nutrient resources. Most mycorrhizas are mutualistic, but in some cases the trend for increasing plant control of fungi culminates in the exploitative mycorrhizas of achlorophyllous, mycoheterotrophic plants. Ectomycorrhizal, ericoid and orchid mycorrhizas, as well as nonmycorrhizal roots, evolved during the period of rapid angiosperm radiation in the Cretaceous. It is hypothesised that roots gradually evolved from rhizomes to provide more suitable habitats for mycorrhizal fungi and provide plants with complex branching and leaves with water and nutrients. Selection pressures have caused the morphological divergence of roots with different types of mycorrizas. Root cortex thickness and exodermis suberization are greatest in obllgately mycorrhizal plants, while nonmycorrhizal plants tend to have fine roots, with more roots hairs and relatively advanced chemical defences. Major coevolutionary trends and the relative success of plants with different root types are discussed. (C) New Phytologist (2002).},

abstract = {We model selection at a locus affecting a quantitative trait (QTL) in the presence of genetic variance due to other loci. The dynamics at the QTL are related to the initial genotypic value and to the background genetic variance of the trait, assuming that background genetic values are normally distributed, under three different forms of selection on the trait. Approximate dynamics are derived under the assumption of small mutation effect. For similar strengths of selection on the trait (i.e, gradient of directional selection beta) the way background variation affects the dynamics at the QTL critically depends on the shape of the fitness function. It generally causes the strength of selection on the QTL to decrease with time. The resulting neutral heterozygosity pattern resembles that of a selective sweep with a constant selection coefficient corresponding to the early conditions. The signature of selection may also be blurred by mutation and recombination in the later part of the sweep. We also study the race between the QTL and its generic background toward a new optimum and find the conditions for a complete sweep. Overall, our results suggest that phenotypic traits exhibiting clear-cut molecular signatures of selection may represent a biased subset of all adaptive traits.},

abstract = {Abstract  Outbreeding has been shown to decrease fitness in a variety of species, including several species of fish. An understanding of the general outcomes following outbreeding is required in order to understand the consequences of conservation-related actions and hybridization in aquaculture. A meta-analysis was conducted on outbreeding studies in fishes using 670 comparisons between parent populations and their hybrid progeny. Five hundred and seventy-six comparisons involved first generation hybrids (F1), and a much smaller number (94) involved second generation hybrids (F2). The overall response to outbreeding in the F1 and F2 generations was positive and significant (F1: d i+* = 0.425  0.121; F2: d i+* = 0.548  0.295, where d i+* is the effect size of studies within generations); however, responses differed when studies were separated into groups describing the experimental environment, taxon, or trait. Findings may be biased by a few studies of large effect. Genetic distance explained little of the variance in effect sizes across studies. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that there is no reliable predictor for the effects of outbreeding in fishes, although inconsistencies in experimental design were noted across studies. Future research should include comparisons in both parental environments in order to detect the underlying mechanisms of outbreeding depression, and should focus on measurement of equivalent sets of fitness-related traits. Experimental design should permit estimation of genetic distances based on quantitative traits, which may in turn be meaningful predictors of the outcomes of outbreeding depression. Concerted and consistent research in this area will provide information of relevance to conservation, aquaculture and evolutionary studies.},

abstract = {Although induced plant responses to herbivory are well studied as mechanisms of resistance, how induction shapes community interactions and ultimately plant fitness is still relatively unknown. Using a wild tomato, Solanum peruvianum, native to the Peruvian Andes, we evaluated the disruption of pollination as a potential ecological cost of induced responses. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic changes in herbivore-attacked plants, such as the herbivore-induced emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), alter pollinator behavior and consequentially affect plant fitness. We conducted a series of manipulative field experiments to evaluate the role of herbivore-induced vegetative and floral VOC emissions as mechanisms by which herbivory affects pollinator behavior. In field surveys and bioassays in the plants' native habitat, we found that real and simulated herbivory (methyl jasmonate application) reduced attractiveness of S. peruvianum flowers to their native pollinators. We show that reduced pollinator preference, not resource limitation due to leaf tissue removal, resulted in reduced seed set. Solitary bee pollinators use floral plant volatiles, emitted in response to herbivory or methyl jasmonate treatment, as cues to avoid inflorescences on damaged plants. This herbivory-induced pollinator limitation can be viewed as a general cost of induced plant responses as well as a specific cost of herbivory-induced volatile emission.},

abstract = {There is an urgent need to thoroughly review and comprehend the effects of urbanization on wildlife in order to understand both the ecological implications of increasing urbanization and how to mitigate its threat to biodiversity globally. We examined patterns in comparative productivity of urban and non-urban passerine birds, using published estimates from paired comparisons, and by reviewing and developing explanations in terms of resources, competitors, predators and other specifically urban environmental factors. The most consistent patterns were for earlier lay dates, lower clutch size, lower nestling weight and lower productivity per nesting attempt in urban landscapes; these were supported by a formal meta-analysis. Nest failure rates did not show consistent patterns across the species considered. We suggest that food availability is a key driver of differences in passerine demography between landscapes. In urban habitats, human-provided food may improve adult condition over winter, leading to earlier lay dates and, in some species, to higher survival and higher breeding densities, but paucity of natural food may lead to lower productivity per nesting attempt. We demonstrate that additional comparative research is needed on a wider range of species, on the effects of natural and human-provided food availability, and on the differences in survival and dispersal between urban and non-urban populations. Importantly, better-targeted research and monitoring is needed in areas that are at greatest threat from urbanization, especially in the developing world.},

We review factors favoring the evolution of wind pollination and analyse the extent of specialization towards such pollination. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that anemophily is more likely to evolve in groups with small, simple flowers and dry pollen. Wind-pollinated plants appear to have a bimodal distribution in selfing rates, but further studies recognizing the possibility of a combination of wind and animal pollination within taxa are needed to clarify this relationship.},

abstract = {Urban environments offer the opportunity to study the role of adaptive and non-adaptive evolutionary processes on an unprecedented scale. While the presence of parallel clines in heritable phenotypic traits is often considered strong evidence for the role of natural selection, non-adaptive evolutionary processes can also generate clines, and this may be more likely when traits have a non-additive genetic basis due to epistasis. In this paper, we use spatially-explicit simulations modelled according to the cyanogenesis (HCN) polymorphism in white clover (Trifolium repens) to examine the formation of phenotypic clines along urbanization gradients under varying levels of drift, gene flow and selection. HCN results from an epistatic interaction between two Mendelian-inherited loci. Our results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of this trait makes natural populations susceptible to decreases in HCN frequencies via drift. Gradients in the strength of drift across a landscape resulted in phenotypic clines with lower frequencies of HCN in strongly drifting populations, giving the misleading appearance of deterministic adaptive changes in the phenotype. Studies of heritable phenotypic change in urban populations should generate null models of phenotypic evolution based on the genetic architecture underlying focal traits prior to invoking selection's role in generating adaptive differentiation.},

abstract = {: The use of a surrogate taxon in conservation planning has become questionable because recent evidence suggests that the correlation of species richness between pairs of taxa is highly variable both taxonomically and geographically. Species richness is only one measure of species diversity, however, and recent studies suggest that investigations of cross‐taxon congruence should consider a broader range of assessment techniques. The cross‐taxon congruence of community similarity between sites among taxa has rarely been examined and may be the most relevant measure of species diversity in the context of coarse‐filter conservation strategies. We examined cross‐taxon congruence patterns of species richness and community similarity (Bray‐Curtis similarity) among birds, butterflies, and vascular plants in montane meadow habitats in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Although patterns of species richness (Spearman rank correlation) varied between taxa, we consistently found a positive correlation in community similarity (Mantel test) between all pair‐wise comparisons of the three taxa (e.g., sites with similar bird communities also had similar butterfly communities). We suggest that the success of a surrogate taxon depends on the technique used to assess surrogacy and the specific approach to conservation planning. In the context of coarse‐filter conservation, measures of community similarity may be more appropriate than measures of species richness. Furthermore, the cross‐taxon congruency of community similarity in our study suggests that coarse‐filter conservation may be tenable in montane meadow communities.},

abstract = {In a time of increasing urbanization, the fundamental value of conserving urban biodiversity remains controversial. How much of a fixed budget should be spent on conservation in urban versus nonurban landscapes? The answer should depend on the goals that drive our conservation actions, yet proponents of urban conservation often fail to specify the motivation for protecting urban biodiversity. This is an important shortcoming on several fronts, including a missed opportunity to make a stronger appeal to those who believe conservation biology should focus exclusively on more natural, wilder landscapes. We argue that urban areas do offer an important venue for conservation biology, but that we must become better at choosing and articulating our goals. We explored seven possible motivations for urban biodiversity conservation: preserving local biodiversity, creating stepping stones to nonurban habitat, understanding and facilitating responses to environmental change, conducting environmental education, providing ecosystem services, fulfilling ethical responsibilities, and improving human well-being. To attain all these goals, challenges must be faced that are common to the urban environment, such as localized pollution, disruption of ecosystem structure, and limited availability of land. There are, however, also challenges specific only to particular goals, meaning that different goals will require different approaches and actions. This highlights the importance of specifying the motivations behind urban biodiversity conservation. If the goals are unknown, progress cannot be assessed.},

abstract = {Distinct floral pollination syndromes have emerged multiple times during the diversification of flowering plants. For example, in western North America, a hummingbird pollination syndrome has evolved more than 100 times, gen-erally from within insect-pollinated lineages. The hummingbird syndrome is characterized by a suite of floral traits that attracts and facilitates pollen move-ment by hummingbirds, while at the same time discourages bee visitation. These floral traits generally include large nectar volume, red flower colour, elongated and narrow corolla tubes and reproductive organs that are exerted from the corolla. A handful of studies have examined the genetic architecture of hummingbird pollination syndrome evolution. These studies find that mutations of relatively large effect often explain increased nectar volume and transition to red flower colour. In addition, they suggest that adaptive suites of floral traits may often exhibit a high degree of genetic linkage, which could facilitate their fixation during pollination syndrome evolution. Here, we explore these emerging generalities by investigating the genetic basis of floral pollination syndrome divergence between two related Penstemon species with different pollination syndromes—bee-pollinated P. neomexicanus and closely related hummingbird-pollinated P. barbatus. In an F 2 mapping population derived from a cross between these two species, we characterized the effect size of genetic loci underlying floral trait divergence associated with the transition to bird pollination, as well as correlation structure of floral trait variation. We find the effect sizes of quantitative trait loci for adaptive floral traits are in line with patterns observed in previous studies, and find strong evidence that suites of floral traits are genetically linked. This linkage may be due to genetic proximity or pleiotropic effects of single causative loci. Inter-estingly, our data suggest that the evolution of floral traits critical for hummingbird pollination was not constrained by negative pleiotropy at loci that show co-localization for multiple traits.},

abstract = {We have studied the relative fitnesses of three genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster in 50 environments.

The environments differed in three factors: parental density, dilution of the medium, and the temperature r{\'{e}}gime and medium composition. Our measure of fitness assessed fecundity and viability relative to a reference genotype. Both MA lines always had lower fitnesses than the selected line, but the difference increased dramatically with dilution of the medium and, especially, crowding. Under the most severe conditions, the performance of the MA lines approached 0. This increased difference in harsh conditions may be caused both by a uniform increase in the magnitude of deleterious effects of all mutations and by the exposure of mutations which are essentially neutral under benign conditions. If the second cause is important, previous experiments are likely to have underestimated the genomic deleterious mutation rate in Drosophila melanogaster more than previously thought.},

We present evidence that natural enemies exert selection on particular plant resistance characters. Specifically, we demonstrate that elimination of natural enemies from an experimental field population of Arabidopsis thaliana alters the pattern of selection on genetic variation in two characters that have been shown to reduce herbivore damage in the field: total glucosinolate concentration and trichome density. The change in pattern of selection reveals that natural enemies imposed selection favoring increased glucosinolate concentration and increased trichome density, and thus, supports one of the major assumptions of the coevolution hypothesis. We also demonstrate that a pattern of stabilizing selection on glucosinolate concentration results from a balance between the costs and benefits associated with increasing levels of this resistance character. This result provides direct confirmation of the appropriateness of cost-benefit models for characterizing the evolution of plant defenses.},

Along the Atlantic coasts of Bretagne, T. repens is sometimes found in populations mixed with the related species Trifolium occidentale, although the latter species usually occurs only in a narrow fringe along the coast, whereas T. repens is a more inland species. No plants of T. occidentale have ever been reported to have linamarase activity. Indeed, of 763 T. occidentale plants studied, none contained linamarase activity. However, the variation in the proportion of cyanotypes in T. repens was enormous, even between sites less than 2 km apart. Our results confirm the presumption that T. repens and T. occidentale are indeed separate species. Both the fact that T. occidentale plants never contain linamarase activity, and the difference in proportion of plants with cyanoglucosides in mixed stands show that gene flow between the species must be rare. These dissimilar distributions strongly indicate that cyanotypic frequencies in adjacent and mixed populations of the very closely related species T. occidentale and T. repens are regulated by different mechanisms.

abstract = {We surveyed the literature published since 1985 for evidence of natural selection and heritability in vegetative functional traits and performance. Our goals were to (1) review patterns of selection on specific functional traits and (2) assess general evolutionary questions about selection and heritability for broad classes of traits. While generalizations about the functional significance of specific traits are premature, several functional hypotheses are supported. For example, herbivores can exert strong selection on secondary chemistry and mechanical defenses, but costs of resistance and negative correlations between defense traits may constrain their evolution. Competitive interactions select for early germination and favor stem elongation and shifts in flowering time where such responses actually minimize competitive effects. In the very few studies of physiology, selection on gas exchange and leaf size is clearly environment dependent. More generally, in reciprocal transplant experiments, populations often are locally adapted, and selection favors the native phenotype. These results suggest that selection is important in functional trait evolution and population differentiation. At the same time, selection often varies in space and time and across life-history episodes. This variation could slow the rate of evolutionary change, maintain genetic variation within populations, and select for plasticity. Analyses of general questions revealed that indirect selection through correlated characters accounts for a substantial portion of total selection on traits and often appears to reinforce the pattern of direct selection. This could be due to environmental effects on multiple phenotypic traits and fitness. Alternatively, indirect selection could contribute to the rapid evolution of suites of traits. We found only weak evidence that traits under strong selection have low heritability, a pattern that has been reported for animals and predicted by some theory. Thus, the rate of evolutionary change may well differ among traits. The strength of selection also depended on the fitness measure, being stronger selection through cumulative fitness than fertility or vegetative performance. Attributes of species' biology and experimental design affected selection and heritability estimates. Heritability was lower in inbreeding species relative to outbreeders, as expected. Heritabilities in controlled environments substantially overestimate estimates from the wild and should not be used as reliable predictors of the rate of adaptive evolutionary change in natural populations. Likewise, broad-sense heritability overestimates narrow-sense heritability and is thus unreliable for predicting evolutionary change in outbreeding species. Future studies of functional trait evolution should focus on physiology and a broader array of phenological and developmental traits. Long-lived species are severely underrepresented in microevolutionary studies, no doubt for practical reasons. Finally, an emphasis should be placed on exploring the nature and effect of trait interactions on fitness, since these are likely to be very important in shaping the course of evolution.},

abstract = {After an ancestral population splits into two allopatric populations, different mutations may fix in each. When pairs of mutations are brought together in a hybrid offspring, epistasis may cause reduced fitness. Such pairs are known as Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibilities. A well-known model of BDM incompatibility due to Orr suggests that the fitness load on hybrids should initially accelerate, and continue to increase as the number of potentially incompatible substitutions increases (the "snowball effect"). In the gene networks model, which violates a key assumption of Orr's model (independence of fixation probabilities), the snowball effect often does not occur. Instead, we describe three possible dynamics in a constant environment: (1) Stabilizing selection can constrain two allopatric populations to remain near-perfectly compatible. (2) Despite constancy of environment, punctuated evolution may obtain; populations may experience rare adaptations asynchronously, permitting incompatibility. (3) Despite stabilizing selection, developmental system drift may permit genetic change, allowing two populations to drift in and out of compatibility. We reinterpret Orr's model in terms of genetic distance. We extend Orr's model to the finite loci case, which can limit incompatibility. Finally, we suggest that neutral evolution of gene regulation in nature, to the point of speciation, is a distinct possibility.},

abstract = {While sexual selection is generally assumed to quickly cause or strengthen prezygotic barriers between sister species, its role in causing postzygotic isolation, through the unattractiveness of intermediate hybrids, is less often examined. Combining 24 years of pedigree data and recently developed species-specific molecular markers from collared (Ficedula albicollis) and pied (Ficedula hypoleuca) flycatchers and their hybrids, we were able to quantify all key components of fitness. To disentangle the relative role of natural and sexual selection acting on F1 hybrid flycatchers, we estimated various fitness components, which when combined represent the total lifetime reproductive success of F1 hybrids, and then compared the different fitness components of F1 hybrids to that of collared flycatchers. Female hybrid flycatchers are sterile, with natural selection being the selective force involved, but male hybrids mainly experienced a reduction in fitness through sexual selection (decreased pairing success and increased rate of being cuckolded). To disentangle the role of sexual selection against male hybrids from a possible effect of genetic incompatibility (on the rate of being cuckolded), we compared male hybrids with pure-bred males expressing intermediate plumage characters. Given that sexual selection against male hybrids is a result of their intermediate plumage, we expect these two groups of males to have a similar fitness reduction. Alternatively, hybrids have reduced fitness owing to genetic incompatibility, in which case their fitness should be lower than that of the intermediate pure-bred males. We conclude that sexual selection against male hybrids accounts for approximately 75{\%} of the reduction in their fitness. We discuss how natural and sexual selection against hybrids may have different implications for speciation and conclude that reinforcement of reproductive barriers may be more likely when there is sexual selection against hybrids.},

abstract = {Genome-wide patterns of genetic divergence reveal mechanisms of adaptation under gene flow. Empirical data show that divergence is mostly concentrated in narrow genomic regions. This pattern may arise because differentiated loci protect nearby mutations from gene flow, but recent theory suggests this mechanism is insufficient to explain the emergence of concentrated differentiation during biologically realistic timescales. Critically, earlier theory neglects an inevitable consequence of genetic drift: stochastic loss of local genomic divergence. Here we demonstrate that the rate of stochastic loss of weak local differentiation increases with recombination distance to a strongly diverged locus and, above a critical recombination distance, local loss is faster than local `gain' of new differentiation. Under high migration and weak selection this critical recombination distance is much smaller than the total recombination distance of the genomic region under selection. Consequently, divergence between populations increases by net gain of new differentiation within the critical recombination distance, resulting in tightly-linked clusters of divergence. The mechanism responsible is the balance between stochastic loss and gain of weak local differentiation, a mechanism acting universally throughout the genome. Our results will help to explain empirical observations and lead to novel predictions regarding changes in genomic architectures during adaptive divergence.},

This model allows the data to determine how the aspect effect changes with elevation and slope. Earlier articles concerning the interactions of slope, aspect, and elevation have been incomplete by either treating elevation as fixed or ignoring the possibility that aspect effect must also involve slope. The proposed set of variables is illustrated in four applications: (1) a hypothetical data set for probability of stocking by “species” having different adaptations to elevation, (2) in a discriminant function for forest/nonforest classification of data from Utah, (3) estimating mean annual increment of Utah forests, and (4) estimating the height asymptote in a mixed-model differential equation predicting Douglas-fir height growth.},

abstract = {The Lande equation forms the basis for our understanding of the short-term evolution of quantitative traits in a multivariate context. It predicts the response to selection as the product of an additive genetic variance matrix and a selection gradient. The selection gradient approximates the force and direction of selection, and the genetic variance matrix quantifies the role of the genetic system in evolution. Attempts to understand the evolutionary significance of the genetic variance matrix are hampered by the fact that the majority of the methods used to characterize and compare variance matrices have not been derived in an explicit theoretical context. We use the Lande equation to derive new measures of the ability of a variance matrix to allow or constrain evolution in any direction in phenotype space. Evolvability captures the ability of a population to evolve in the direction of selection when stabilizing selection is absent. Conditional evolvability captures the ability of a population to respond to directional selection in the presence of stabilizing selection on other trait combinations. We then derive measures of character autonomy and integration from these evolvabilities. We study the properties of these measures and show how they can be used to interpret and compare variance matrices. As an illustration, we show that divergence of wing shape in the dipteran family Drosophilidae has proceeded in directions that have relatively high evolvabilities.},

Polyploid plants can occupy different geographic ranges than their diploid progenitors, but the factors responsible for maintaining these range differences are poorly understood. Polyploidy can have significant physiological consequences, and the present study aims to determine whether previously described physiological differences between cytotypes are correlated with climatic niches and geographic distributions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Prior research indicates that tetraploid plants of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) are more tolerant of drought and less tolerant of freezing than diploids, which suggests that they should occupy a niche that is warmer and drier than that of diploids. We extracted climate data for 134 populations of C. angustifolium classified as pure diploid, pure tetraploid, or mixed-ploidy. We compared climatic conditions between these population categories and generated ecological niche models to compare their geographic distribution with prior qualitative estimates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Pure tetraploid populations occupy habitats that are warmer and drier than those of pure diploid populations. Mixed-ploidy populations occur in habitats that are not strictly intermediate between pure diploid and pure tetraploid populations, but are as cold as pure diploid populations and have intermediate soil moisture deficits. Our niche models were similar to previous qualitative estimates of cytotype geographic distribution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The correspondence between the physiological tolerances of cytotypes, their climatic niches, and their geographic distributions suggests that physiological traits are at least partially responsible for differences in the realized climatic niches of diploid and tetraploid C. angustifolium.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Treatment and survival rates within Scotland for patients with lung cancer seem lower than in many other European countries. No study of lung cancer has attempted to specifically investigate the association between variation in investigation, comorbidity, and treatment and outcome between different centers. METHODS:: Patient demographics, World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and primary treatment modality were recorded. In addition to recording the comorbidities present in each patient, the severity of each comorbidity was graded on a 4-point scale (0-3) using validated severity scales. Data were collected as the patient was investigated and entered in an anonymized format into a database designed for the study. RESULTS:: Prospectively collected data from 882 patients diagnosed with lung cancer in four Scottish centers. A number of statistically significant differences were identified between centers. These included investigation, treatment between centers (i.e., surgical rates), age, tumor histology, smoking history, socioeconomic profile, ventilatory function, and performance status. Predictors of declining performance status included increasing severity of a number of comorbidities, age, lower socioeconomic status, and specific centers. CONCLUSIONS:: This study has identified many significant intercenter differences within Scotland. We believe this to be the first study to identify nontumor factors independent of performance status that together limit the ability to deliver radical, possibly curative, therapy to our lung cancer population. It is only by identifying such factors that we can hope to improve on the relatively poor outlook for the majority of Scottish patients with lung cancer.},

Studies investigating the community dynamics of microbes have relied heavily on gene-centric metagenomic profiling using two genes (16S rRNA and cpn60) to identify and track Bacteria. While there have been criteria formalized for barcoding of eukaryotes, these criteria have not been used to evaluate gene targets for other domains of life. Using the framework of the International Barcode of Life we evaluated DNA barcodes for Bacteria. Candidates from the 16S rRNA gene and the protein coding cpn60 gene were evaluated. Within complete bacterial genomes in the public domain representing 983 species from 21 phyla, the largest difference between median pairwise inter- and intra-specific distances ("barcode gap") was found from cpn60. Distribution of sequence diversity along the ∼555 bp cpn60 target region was remarkably uniform. The barcode gap of the cpn60 universal target facilitated the faithful de novo assembly of full-length operational taxonomic units from pyrosequencing data from a synthetic microbial community. Analysis supported the recognition of both 16S rRNA and cpn60 as DNA barcodes for Bacteria. The cpn60 universal target was found to have a much larger barcode gap than 16S rRNA suggesting cpn60 as a preferred barcode for Bacteria. A large barcode gap for cpn60 provided a robust target for species-level characterization of data. The assembly of consensus sequences for barcodes was shown to be a reliable method for the identification and tracking of novel microbes in metagenomic studies.},

abstract = {The classification of reproductive isolating barriers laid out by Dobzhansky and Mayr has motivated and structured decades of research on speciation. We argue, however, that this classification is incomplete and that the unique contributions of a major source of reproductive isolation have often been overlooked. Here, we describe reproductive barriers that derive from the reduced survival of immigrants upon reaching foreign habitats that are ecologically divergent from their native habitat. This selection against immigrants reduces encounters and thus mating opportunities between individuals from divergently adapted populations. It also reduces the likelihood that successfully mated immigrant females will survive long enough to produce their hybrid offspring. Thus, natural selection against immigrants results in distinctive elements of premating and postmating reproductive isolation that we hereby dub "immigrant inviability." We quantify the contributions of immigrant inviability to total reproductive isolation by examining study systems where,multiple components of reproductive isolation have been measured and demonstrate that these contributions are frequently greater than those of traditionally recognized reproductive barriers. The relevance of immigrant inviability is further illustrated by a consideration of population-genetic theory, a review of selection against immigrant alleles in hybrid zone studies, and an examination of its participation in feedback loops that influence the evolution of additional reproductive barriers. Because some degree of immigrant inviability will commonly exist between populations that exhibit adaptive ecological divergence, we emphasize that these barriers play critical roles in ecological modes of speciation. We hope that the formal recognition of immigrant inviability and our demonstration of its evolutionary importance will stimulate more explicit empirical studies of its contributions to speciation.},

abstract = {Correlational selection favors combinations of traits and is a key element of many models of phenotypic and genetic evolution. Multiple regression techniques for measuring selection allow for the direct estimation of correlational selection gradients, yet few studies in natural populations have investigated this process. Color patterns and antipredator behaviors of snakes are thought to function interactively in predator escape and therefore may be subject to correlational selection. To investigate this hypothesis, I studied the survivorship of juvenile garter snakes, Thamnophis ordinoides, as a function of a suite of escape behaviors and color pattern. The only natural selection detected favored opposite combinations of stripedness of the color pattern and the tendency to perform during escape evasive behaviors called reversals. This selection presumably results from optical illusions created by moving patterns and their effects on visually foraging predators. Analysis of the bivariate selection surface shows that pure correlational selection can be thought of as a series of linear selection functions on one trait whose slopes depend on the value of the second trait. Alternatively, viewing the selection surface along its major axes reveals stabilizing and disruptive components of correlational selection. It is further shown that correlational selection alone can promote genetic variance and covariance within a generation. This phenomenon may be partially responsible for the extreme variation in color pattern and the genetic covariance between color pattern and behavior observed in natural populations of T. ordinoides.},

abstract = {Hybridization may drive rare taxa to extinction through genetic swamping, where the rare form is replaced by hybrids, or by demographic swamping, where popu- lation growth rates are reduced due to the wasteful production of maladaptive hybrids. Conversely, hybridization may rescue the viability of small, inbred popu- lations. Understanding the factors that contribute to destructive versus construc- tive outcomes of hybridization is key to managing conservation concerns. Here, we survey the literature for studies of hybridization and extinction to identify the ecological, evolutionary, and genetic factors that critically affect extinction risk through hybridization. We find that while extinction risk is highly situation dependent, genetic swamping is much more frequent than demographic swamp- ing. In addition, human involvement is associated with increased risk and high reproductive isolation with reduced risk. Although climate change is predicted to increase the risk of hybridization-induced extinction, we find little empirical sup- port for this prediction. Similarly, theoretical and experimental studies imply that genetic rescue through hybridization may be equally or more probable than demographic swamping, but our literature survey failed to support this claim. We conclude that halting the introduction of hybridization-prone exotics and restoring mature and diverse habitats that are resistant to hybrid establishment should be management priorities.},

abstract = {Sexual isolation is a critical form of reproductive isolation in the early stages of animal speciation, yet little is known about the genetic basis of divergent mate preferences and preference cues in young species. Heliconius butterflies, well known for their diversity of wing color patterns, mate assortatively as a result of divergence in male preference for wing patterns. Here we show that the specific cue used by Heliconius cydno and Heliconius pachinus males to recognize conspecific females is the color of patches on the wings. In addition, male mate preference segregates with forewing color in hybrids, indicating a genetic association between the loci responsible for preference and preference cue. Quantitative trait locus mapping places a preference locus coincident with the locus that determines forewing color, which itself is perfectly linked to the wing patterning candidate gene, wingless. Furthermore, yellow-colored males of the polymorphic race H. cydno alithea prefer to court yellow females, indicating that wing color and color preference are controlled by loci that are located in an inversion or are pleiotropic effects of a single locus. Tight genetic associations between preference and preference cue, although rare, make divergence and speciation particularly likely because the effects of natural and sexual selection on one trait are transferred to the other, leading to the coordinated evolution of mate recognition. This effect of linkage on divergence is especially important in Heliconius because differentiation of wing color patterns in the genus has been driven and maintained by natural selection for M{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}llerian mimicry.},

Here we develop a high-quality reference genome assembly for threespine sticklebacks. By sequencing the genomes of twenty additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater populations, we identify a genome-wide set of loci that are consistently associated with marine–freshwater divergence. Our results indicate that reuse of globally shared standing genetic variation, including chromosomal inversions, has an important role in repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater sticklebacks, and in the maintenance of divergent ecotypes during early stages of reproductive isolation. Both coding and regulatory changes occur in the set of loci underlying marine–freshwater evolution, but regulatory changes appear to predominate in this well known example of repeated adaptive evolution in nature.$\backslash$nView full text},

Especially the next generation sequencing technologies can be expected to have a tremendous effect on fungal biodiversity and ecology research. In order to realise the full potential of these exciting techniques by accelerating biodiversity assessments, identification procedures of fungi need to be adapted to the emerging demands of modern large-scale ecological studies. But how should fungal species be identified in the near future? While the answer might seem trivial to most microbiologists, taxonomists working with fungi may have other views. In the present review, we will analyse the state of the art of the so-called barcoding initiatives in the light of fungi, and we will seek to evaluate emerging trends in the field. We will furthermore demonstrate that the usability of DNA barcoding as a major tool for identification of fungi largely depends on the development of high-quality sequence databases that are thoroughly curated by taxonomists and systematists.},

abstract = {A basic principle of natural selection on correlated characters is expressed as an adaptive topography for the vector of mean phenotypes in a population. Under some simple conditions on the pattern of phenotypic and genetic covariation within populations, selection only on body size, certain types of multivariate selection, and random genetic drift in a stochastic phylogeny are each expected to produce allometric evolution, i.e., straight lines or linear regressions on logarithmic coordinates. The orientation of these lines is determined by genetic parameters of the populations. Using this theory, phylogenetic or comparative information can be combined with experimental data on population genetic parameters to test hypotheses about past selective forces. Data from selection experiments on brain and body weights in mice support the conclusions that 1 the short-term differentiation of brain and body sizes in very closely related mammalian forms resulted either from directional selection mostly on body size with changes in brain sizes largely a genetically correlated response, or from random genetic drift; 2 during the long-term allometric diversification within most mammalian orders there has been more net directional selection on brain sizes than on body sizes. It is suggested that encephalization in primates decreased the genetic correlation between brain size and body size within populations, which facilitated further encephalization in the human lineage by avoiding antagonistic selection on brain and body sizes. The evolution of brain:body ontogeny is briefly discussed.},

Aim of the study: The ITS2 region, which has several characteristics that make it a valuable DNA barcode, was studied to discriminate the stems of medicinal vines to confirm their identities and ensure their safe application in pharmaceuticals by using complementary discrimination methods. Materials and methods: Complementary discrimination methods were performed on two datasets, including 393 samples of 170 species from 22 genera 13 families, which belonged to medicinal vines and their adulterants. Based on the primary ITS2 sequences, three main discrimination methods (phylogenetic tree, the nearest distance, and BLAST 1) were adopted to identify species. Moreover, we applied both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) structures of ITS2 to differentiate species. Results: ITS2 performed well, with over 95.0{\%} of species and 100{\%} of genera being correctly differentiated for the two datasets. All results showed that the ITS2 region unveiled a remarkable ability to identify closely related species within different families and genera. Conclusion: Our findings supported that the ITS2 region was an efficient marker for authentication of medicinal vines. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A recent paper presented a synthetic analysis of temporal variation in selection in natural populations. The authors concluded that there is substantial variation in the strength and direction of selection over time, but acknowledged that sampling error would result in estimates of selection that were more variable than the true values. We reanalyze their dataset using techniques that account for the necessary effect of sampling error to inflate apparent levels of variation and show that directional selection is remarkably constant over time, both in magnitude and direction. Thus we cannot claim that the available data support the existence of substantial temporal heterogeneity in selection. Nonetheless, we conject that temporal variation in selection could be important, but that there are good reasons why it may not appear in the available data. These new analyses highlight the importance of applying techniques that estimate parameters of the distribution of selection, rather than parameters of the distribution of estimated selection (which will reflect both sampling error and "real" variation in selection); indeed, despite availability of methods for the former, focus on the latter has been common in synthetic reviews of the aspects of selection in nature, and can lead to serious misinterpretations.},

As a single variable, the amount of native vegetation remaining also influenced extinction rates, particularly in cities {\textgreater} 200 years old. Our study demonstrates that the legacies of landscape transformations by agrarian and urban development last for hundreds of years, and modern cities potentially carry a large extinction debt.

(white clover), a type of most important pasture legume, has been studied at different elevations of Darjeeling Himalaya (latitude-27degrees 2' 57'' N, longitude- 88degrees 15' 45" E). Release of HCN takes place due to reaction between cyanogenic glucosides stored in vacuoles of the leaf cell and the corresponding enzyme beta-glucosidase present in another compartment, often cell wall. Cyanogenesis, a defense system in plant, protects the clover from herbivore and inhibits grazing. Biochemical analysis showed the presence and absence of the cyanogenesis trait within the population in different proportions at different elevations. Acyanogenic individuals also showed variations with respect to presence or absence of either cyanogenic glucosides or beta-glucosidase enzyme or both. The distribution of cyanogenic and acyanogenic plants was found in all places, but at lower altitudes (2084-2094 m) the dominating plants were cyanogenic whereas in higher altitude (2560 m) the dominating plants were acyanogenic. It was observed that blister beetle (Mylabris pustalata Thunb.) and the mollusc (Macrochlamys tusgurium Benson.) were the most common consumer of leaflets of T. repens. Six categories of damage on white clover leaf by these animals were recorded. Our results suggest that the two selective factors or forces i.e. very cold temperature (harmful to cyanogenic plants) at higher altitude as well as indiscriminate but preferential predation (harmful to acyanogenic plants) interact to affect the system of cyanogenesis and also to cause the stable and protective polymorphism in T. repens rather than genotypic differences present among the plants.},

abstract = {Although often considered as evolutionary dead ends, selfing taxa may make an important contribution to plant evolution through hybridization with related outcrossing lineages. However, there is a shortage of studies examining the evolutionary dynamics of hybridization between outcrossing and selfing taxa. On the basis of differential pollinator attractiveness, production and competitive ability of pollen, as well as levels of inbreeding depression, we predict that the early products of hybridization between outcrossing and selfing lineages will be F1s and first-generation backcrosses sired mainly by the outcrossing lineage, together with selfed F2s containing a limited genetic contribution from the outcrosser. These predictions were tested using amplified fragment length polymorphism and chloroplast markers to analyze the composition of a recent hybrid swarm between predominantly outcrossing Geum rivale and predominantly selfing Geum urbanum. In line with predictions, the hybrid swarm comprised both parental species together with F1s and first-generation backcrosses to G. rivale alone. Chloroplast data suggested that G. rivale was the pollen parent for both observed hybrid classes. However, there was no evidence for F2 individuals, despite the fact that the F1 was fully self-compatible and able to auto-pollinate. The pollen fertility of F1s was only 30{\%} lower than that of the parental taxa, and was fully restored in backcross hybrids. Predicting future evolution in the hybrid swarm will require an understanding of the mating patterns within and among the mix of parental, F1 and backcross genotypes that are currently present. However, these results support the hypothesis that introgression is likely to be asymmetrical from selfing to outcrossing lineages.},

         {\textless}p{\textgreater}New species arise through the evolution of reproductive barriers between formerly interbreeding lineages. Yet, comprehensive assessments of potential reproductive barriers, which are needed to make inferences on processes driving speciation, are only available for a limited number of systems. In this study, we estimated individual and cumulative strengths of seven prezygotic and six postzygotic reproductive barriers between the recently diverged taxa {\textless}i{\textgreater}Silene dioica{\textless}/i{\textgreater} (L.) Clairv. and {\textless}i{\textgreater}S. latifolia{\textless}/i{\textgreater} Poiret using both published and new data. A combination of multiple partial reproductive barriers resulted in near‐complete reproductive isolation between {\textless}i{\textgreater}S. dioica{\textless}/i{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}S. latifolia{\textless}/i{\textgreater} that is consistent with earlier estimates of gene flow between the taxa. Extrinsic barriers associated with adaptive ecological divergence were most important, while intrinsic postzygotic barriers had moderate individual strength but contributed only little to total reproductive isolation. These findings are in line with ecological divergence as driver of speciation. We further found extensive variation in extrinsic reproductive isolation, ranging from sites with very strong selection against migrants and hybrids to intermediate sites where substantial hybridization is possible. This situation may allow for or even promote heterogeneous genetic divergence.

abstract = {Despite the long-standing interest of biologists in patterns of correlation and phenotypic integration, little attention has been paid to patterns of correlation across a broad phylogenetic spectrum.We report analyses of mean phenotypic correlations among a variety of linear measurements from a wide diversity of plants and animals, addressing questions about function, development, integrationandmodularity. These analyses suggest that vertebrates, hemimeta- bolous insects and vegetative traits in plants have similar mean correlations, around 0.5. Traits of holometabolous insects are much more highly correlated, with a mean correlation of 0.84; thismay be due to developmental homeostasis caused by lower spatial and temporal environmental variance during complete metamorphosis. The lowest mean correlations were those between floral and vegetative traits, consistent with Berg's ideas about functional independence between these modules. Within trait groups, the lowest mean correlations were among vertebrate head traits and floral traits (0.38–0.39). The former may be due to independence between skull modules. While there is little evi- dence for floral integration overall, certain sets of functionally related floral traits are highly integrated. A case study of the latter is described from wild radish flowers.},

abstract = {Urban ecology has quickly become established as a central part of ecological thinking. As cities continue to grow in size and number, two questions serve to unify this broad and multidisciplinary research landscape: (1) how can urban ecology contribute to the science of ecology, and (2) how can urban ecology be applied to make cities more livable and sustainable? In spite of the advances made thus far, there are many unexplored ways of integrating the science and application of urban ecology. Although scientists assess and make predictions regarding the connections between environmental and socioeconomic processes, practitioners involved in real-world application deal with urban planning and with designing ecosystem services to improve living con- ditions for all urban inhabitants and to make cities more sustainable. Research in urban ecosystems can be developed from many different perspectives, and we suggest that each perspective has something to offer both society and the science of ecology. We present several research perspectives and describe how these can inte- grate conceptual and applied aspects to bridge the figurative gaps between trees, buildings, and people.},

Few studies have systematically examined the ability of mtDNA from the DNA barcode region (658 base pair fragment of the 59 terminus of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene) to distinguish species based on range-wide sampling of specimens from closely related species. Here we examined the utility of DNA barcode data for delimiting species, associating life stages, and as a potential genetic marker for phylogeographic studies by analyzing a rangewide sample of closely related Chilean representatives of the caddisfly genus Smicridea subgenus Smicridea. Our data revealed the existence of 7 deeply diverged, previously unrecognized lineages and confirmed the existence of 2 new species: Smicridea (S.) patinae, new species and Smicridea (S.) lourditae, new species. Based on our current taxonomic evaluation, we considered the other 5 lineages to be cryptic species. The DNA barcode data proved useful in delimiting species within Chilean Smicridea (Smicridea) and were suitable for life-stage associations. The data also contained sufficient intraspecific variation to make the DNA barcode a candidate locus for widespread application in phylogeographic studies.},

abstract = {Changes in host acceptance is an important factor in the host specialization of phytophagous insects, and knowledge of the genetic organization of this behaviour is necessary in order to understand how host shifts occur. Here we describe the inheritance of adult host acceptance (oviposition) in three closely related species of Yponomeuta Latreille (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae), and their interspecific hybrids. Yponomeuta cagnagellus (H{\"{u}}bner), a specialist on Euonymus europaeus L. (Celastraceae), Y. malinellus Zeller, a specialist on Malus spp. (Rosaceae), and Y. padellus (L.), oligophagous on a number of Rosaceae, were tested for their acceptance of parental hosts in choice tests. Acceptance of E. europaeus is semi-dominant in hybrids of Y. cagnagellus×Y. padellus, and in hybrids of Y. cagnagellus×Y. malinellus. The dominance of this acceptance was confirmed in oviposition tests with backcross hybrids: backcross hybrids F1 × Y. cagnagellus oviposited mainly on E. europaeus and F1 × Y. padellus still deposited more than half of their egg masses on E. europaeus. Reciprocal hybrids did not differ in their host acceptance, indicating that the trait is autosomal. We further studied the effect of larval food on adult host acceptance (‘Hopkins host selection principle') in split full-sib F1 families. Larval diet influenced oviposition only in one of two hybrid crosses. The F1 hybrid of Y. padellus× Y. cagnagellus, reared on Prunus spinosa L., deposited a significantly lower percentage of egg masses on E. europaeus compared to their full-sib sisters fed with E. europaeus. We did not find this in the reciprocal cross. However, still more than half of the egg masses are deposited on E. europaeus by hybrids that have no experience on this host. We conclude that the semi-dominant character of acceptance of E. europaeus and a tendency of Rosaceae-feeding Yponomeuta to deposit egg masses on this host may have created the opportunity for the host shift of the predecessor of Y. cagnagellus from Rosaceae to the Celastraceae. This shift may have been further facilitated by a weak tendency of adults to oviposit on their larval food source.},

abstract = {The sterility and inviability of species hybrids is thought to evolve by the accumulation of genes that cause generally recessive, incompatible epistatic interactions between species. Most analyses of the loci involved in such hybrid incompatibilities have suffered from low genetic resolution. Here I present a fine-resolution genetic screen that allows systematic counting, mapping, and characterizing of a large number of hybrid incompatibility loci in a model genetic system. Using small autosomal deletions from D. melanogaster and a hybrid rescue mutation from D. simulans, I measured the viability of hybrid males that are simultaneously hemizygous for a small region of the D. simulans autosomal genome and hemizygous for the D. melanogaster X chromosome. These hybrid males are exposed to the full effects of any recessive-recessive epistatic incompatibilities present in these regions. A screen of approximately 70{\%} of the D. simulans autosomal genome reveals 20 hybrid-lethal and 20 hybrid-semilethal regions that are incompatible with the D. melanogaster X. In further crosses, I confirm the epistatic nature of hybrid lethality by showing that all of the incompatibilities are rescued when the D. melanogaster X is replaced with a D. simulans X. Combined with information from previous studies, these results show that the number of recessive incompatibilities is approximately eightfold larger than the number of dominant ones. Finally, I estimate that a total of approximately 191 hybrid-lethal incompatibilities separate D. melanogaster and D. simulans, indicating extensive functional divergence between these species' genomes.},

abstract = {This review contains a description of a research program for the study of maladaptation, defined here in terms of deviation from adaptive peaks. Maladaptation has many genetic causes, including mutation, inbreeding, drift, gene flow, heterozygote advantage and pleiotropy. Degrees of maladaptation are determined by genetic architecture and the relationship between the rates of selective, environmental change and the nature and extent of genetic responses to selection. The empirical analysis of maladaptation requires: (1) recognition of putative maladaptation, using methods from phylogenetics, teleonomy, development and genetics, followed by an assessment of the nature and degree of deviation from adaptation, using studies of natural selection and teleonomy; (2) determination of the causes of the deviation, using analyses of genetics, development, or other methods. Conditions for unambiguously identifying maladaptation are considerably more stringent than those for demonstrating adaptation and remarkably few studies have clearly identified and characterised maladaptative traits. A thorough understanding of the nature of phenotypic variation will never be achieved without an analysis of the scope and usual causes of maladaptation.},

abstract = {Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes, or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation, and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable barriers to making practical use of this technique have been discussed.},

Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.},

Frombehavioral studies and mathematical evolutionary simulations, we further demonstrate that disparity in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in one of these cavefish populations that has hybridized with surface fish can be explained by paternal inheritance of VAB. The results suggest that parental genetic effects in adaptive behaviors may be important factors in biasing mitochondrial DNA inheritance in natural populations that are subject to introgression.},

Most (9/12) traits appear to be controlled in part by at least one major QTL explaining {\textgreater}/=25{\%} of the total phenotypic variance.

abstract = {Insufficient genetic variability and the swamping effects of gene flow are inadequate expla- nations of limits to natural selection. Comparison of evolutionary responses in different ropu- lations subjected to similar selective forces, comparison of rare and widespread species, and comparison of marginal and central populations are all neglected research areas that bear on the nature of limits to natural selection. Plant populations provide us with well-defined, operationally viable systems for addressing these comparisons. Several possible constraints on range extension of ecologically marginal populations are considered in detail. Selection on fitness components that are themselves negatively correlated will be ineffective: such nega- tive correlations are to be expected in natural populations. Small size of marginal populations will reduce severely the probability of obtaining appropriate character combinations; it will increase the swamping effects of gene flow; and it may lead to inbreeding depression effects. Gene flow will have different effects depending on whether the genes concerned are effectively neutral, advantageous, or deleterious in the population into which they migrate. Gene flow will spread beneficial genes rapidly, but may retard divergence if density of marginal popula- tions is low and swamping effects are high. Finally a population entering a new habitat is likely to meet new competitors and predators: the coevolutionary responses of the latter may counteract adaptive responses by the species undergoing range extension. All these factors are likely to interact in important ways in marginal populations. The study of limits to natural selection is likely to be a fruitful future research area, and one in which the detailed documnenta- tion of the systematist will provide invaluable baseline information.},

abstract = {The novel weapons hypothesis states that some invasive weed species owe part of their success as invaders to allelopathy mediated by allelochemicals that are new to the native species. Presumably, no resistance has evolved among the native species to this new allelochemical (i.e., the novel weapon). In their native habitat, however, the plants that co-evolved with these invasive species have theoretically evolved defenses that obviate the allelochemical advantage. Previous studies have claimed that catechin is such a novel weapon of spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe = C. maculosa), an invasive species in the non-native habitat of North America. These studies indicated that (-)-catechin is more phytotoxic than (+)-catechin. Other studies have not found sufficient catechin in field soils to support this theory. We report that (-)-catechin and (+)-catechin are essentially equal, but poorly phytotoxic to a variety of plant species in bioassays without soil. In a dose/response experiment with Montana soils, we found the lowest dose for a growth reduction of two native Montana grasses (Koeleria macrantha and Festuca idahoensis) by a racemic mixture of ( plus or minus )-catechin that ranged from about 25 to 50mM, concentrations, orders of magnitude higher than expected in nature. Autoclaving the soil before adding the catechin did not affect the activity of catechin. We found (-)-catechin to be a potent antioxidant, in contrast to a previous claim that it acts as an allelochemical by causing oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that catechin is not a novel weapon of spotted knapweed and that other allelochemical(s) or alternative mechanisms must be found to explain the success of this species as an invader in North America.},

abstract = {One of the most powerful drivers of speciation in plants is pollinator-mediated disruptive selection, which leads to the divergence of floral traits adapted to the morphology and behavior of different pollinators. Despite the widespread importance of this speciation mechanism, its genetic basis has been explored in only a few groups. Here, we characterize the genetic basis of pollinator-mediated divergence of two species in genus Ipomopsis, I. guttata and I. tenuifolia, using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of floral traits and other variable phenotypes. We detected one to six QTLs per trait, with each QTL generally explaining small to modest amounts of the phenotypic variance of a backcross hybrid population. In contrast, flowering time and anthocyanin abundance (a metric of color variation) were controlled by a few QTLs of relatively large effect. QTLs were strongly clustered within linkage groups, with 26 of 37 QTLs localized to six marker-interval 'hotspots,' all of which harbored pleiotropic QTLs. In contrast to other studies that have examined the genetic basis of pollinator shifts, our results indicate that, in general, mutations of small to modest effect on phenotype were involved. Thus, the evolutionary transition between the distinct pollination modes of I. guttata and I. tenuifolia likely proceeded incrementally, rather than saltationally.},

abstract = {Comparative studies of the genetic architecture of different types of traits were initially prompted by the expectation that traits under strong directional selection (fitness traits) should have lower levels of genetic variability than those mainly under weak stabilizing selection (nonfitness traits). Hence, early comparative studies revealing lower heritabilities of fitness than nonfitness traits were first framed in terms of giving empirical support for this prediction, but subsequent treatments have effectively reversed this view. Fitness traits seem to have higher levels of additive genetic variance than nonfitness traits - an observation that has been explained in terms of the larger number loci influencing fitness as compared to nonfitness traits. This hypothesis about the larger functional architecture of fitness than nonfitness traits is supported by their higher mutational variability, which is hard to reconcile without evoking capture of mutational variability over many loci. The lower heritabilities of fitness than nonfitness traits, despite the higher additive genetic variance of the former, occur because of their higher residual variances. Recent comparative studies of dominance contributions for different types of traits, together with theoretical predictions and a large body of indirect evidence, suggest an important role of dominance variance in determining levels of residual variance for fitness-traits. The role of epistasis should not be discounted either, since a large number of loci increases the potential for epistatic interactions, and epistasis is strongly implicated in hybrid breakdown.},

abstract = {White clover is polymorphic for cyanogenesis, with both cyanogenic and acyanogenic plants occurring in nature. This chemical defense polymorphism is one of the longest-studied and best-documented examples of an adaptive polymorphism in plants. It is controlled by two independently segregating genes: Ac/ac controls the presence/absence of cyanogenic glucosides; and Li/li controls the presence/absence of their hydrolyzing enzyme, linamarase. Whereas Li is well characterized at the molecular level, Ac has remained unidentified. Here we report evidence that Ac corresponds to a gene encoding a cytochrome P450 of the CYP79D protein subfamily (CYP79D15), and we describe the apparent molecular basis of the Ac/ac polymorphism. CYP79D orthologs catalyze the first step in cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis in other cyanogenic plant species. In white clover, Southern hybridizations indicate that CYP79D15 occurs as a single-copy gene in cyanogenic plants but is absent from the genomes of ac plants. Gene-expression analyses by RT-PCR corroborate this finding. This apparent molecular basis of the Ac/ac polymorphism parallels our previous findings for the Li/li polymorphism, which also arises through the presence/absence of a single-copy gene. The nature of these polymorphisms may reflect white clover's evolutionary origin as an allotetraploid derived from cyanogenic and acyanogenic diploid progenitors.},

During three successive years, three allozyme loci were studied in order to compare: the level of genetic variation in d. Galeata (g), d. Cucullata (c) and their interspecific hybrid (c x g). This data set was used to investigate: whether cx g hybrids are regularly produced by the parental species and to what extent backcrossing takes place in this species complex. G and c x g were the most abundant taxa, whereas c was only abundant in late summer and autumn. Genetic diversity was highest in c, lowest in g, and intermediate in c x g. Pgm and pgi allele frequencies of c x g were not intermediate to those of the parental species but were more similar to g than to c. In addition, almost no significant deviations from hardy-weinberg were observed. An upgma analysis of nei's genetic distances showed that c x g hybrids are more closely related to g (difference {\textless}0.04), Than to c (difference 0.30). My data suggest, in accordance with other studies, that c x g hybrids are probably still formed by the parental species, though not necessarily every year. Furthermore, my data suggest that backcrossing occurred frequently, and led to introgression of c alleles into g.},

It is, therefore, essential to gain an understanding of the population structure and the demographic history of the urban and neighbouring rural populations before studying adaptation at the genome level. Here, we investigate populations of the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), a species that colonized South American cities just a few decades ago. We assembled a high-quality genome of the burrowing owl and re-sequenced 137 owls from three urban-rural population pairs at 17-fold median sequencing coverage per individual. Our data indicate that each city was independently colonized by a limited number of founders and that restricted gene flow occurred between neighbouring urban and rural populations, but not between urban populations of different cities. Using long-range linkage disequilibrium statistics in an approximate Bayesian computation approach, we estimated consistently lower population sizes in the recent past for the urban populations in comparison to the rural ones. The current urban populations all show reduced standing variation in rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but with different subsets of rare SNPs in different cities. This lowers the potential for local adaptation based on rare variants and makes it harder to detect consistent signals of selection in the genome.},

In contrast, the mechanisms by which plants resist enemies that consume floral parts or resources are much less known, even though damage to floral tissue usually has tighter links to plant fitness than damage to leaf tissue. Many plants experience nectar robbing, whereby floral visitors remove nectar from flowers, often without pollinating. Nectar robbers can reduce plant fitness to degrees comparable to, or even surpassing, reduction by herbivores. However, because nectar attracts both pollinators and nectar robbers, plants face a dilemma in defending against nectar robbers without also deterring pollinators.

A retrospective analysis of their genomes revealed that translocations between the chromosomes of these species do not correlate with the group's sequence-based phylogeny (that is, translocations do not drive the process of speciation). However, that analysis was unable to infer what contribution such rearrangements make to reproductive isolation between these organisms. Here, we report experiments that take an interventionist, rather than a retrospective approach to studying speciation, by reconfiguring the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome so that it is collinear with that of Saccharomyces mikatae. We demonstrate that this imposed genomic collinearity allows the generation of interspecific hybrids that produce a large proportion of spores that are viable, but extensively aneuploid. We obtained similar results in crosses between wild-type S. cerevisiae and the naturally collinear species Saccharomyces paradoxus, but not with non-collinear crosses. This controlled comparison of the effect of chromosomal translocation on species barriers suggests a mechanism for the generation of redundancy in the S. cerevisiae genome.},

However, after a series of studies yielding conflicting results, research in the field slowed significantly. Recent findings, on how ecological factors may lead to divergence in both song and morphology, necessitate a re-examination. We focus primarily on species with learned song, examine conflicting results in the literature and propose some potential new directions for future studies. We believe an integrative approach, including an examination of the role of ecology in divergent selection, is essential for gaining insight into the role of song in the evolution of assortative mating. Habitat-dependent selection on both song and fitness-related characteristics can lead to parallel divergence in these traits. Song may, therefore, provide females with acoustic cues to find males that are most fit for a particular habitat. In analysing the role of song learning in reproductive divergence, we focus on post-dispersal plasticity in a conceptual framework. We argue that song learning may initially constrain reproductive divergence, while in the later stages of population divergence it may promote speciation.},

We asked how strong are viability and sexual selection, and whether strength of selection is correlated with the time scale over which it was measured. Estimates of the magnitude of directional selection ( beta) were exponentially distributed, with few estimates greater than 0.50 and most estimates less than 0.15. Sexual selection (measured by mating success) appeared stronger than viability selection (measured by survival). Viability selection that was measured over short periods (days) was typically stronger than selection measured over longer periods (months and years), but the strength of sexual selection did not vary with duration of selection episodes; as a result, sexual selection was stronger than viability selection over longer time scales (months and years), but not over short time scales (days).},

abstract = {Parallel evolution is often assumed to result from repeated adaptation to novel, yet ecologically similar, environments. Here we develop and analyze a mathematical model that predicts the probability of parallel genetic evolution from standing genetic variation as a function of the strength of phenotypic selection and constraints imposed by genetic architecture. Our results show that the probability of parallel genetic evolution increases with the strength of natural selection and effective population size, and is particularly likely to occur for genes with large phenotypic effects. Building on these results, we develop a Bayesian framework for estimating the strength of parallel phenotypic selection from genetic data. Using extensive individual based simulations, we show that our estimator is robust across a wide range of genetic and evolutionary scenarios and provides a useful tool for rigorously testing the hypothesis that parallel genetic evolution is the result of adaptive evolution. An important result that emerges from our analyses is that existing studies of parallel genetic evolution frequently rely on data that is insufficient for distinguishing between adaptive evolution and neutral evolution driven by random genetic drift. Overcoming this challenge will require sampling more populations and the inclusion of larger numbers of loci. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

In particular, these models assume that the distribution of fitness effects among new mutations is in the domain of attraction of the so-called Gumbel-type extreme value distribution. This assumption has not, however, been justified on any biological or theoretical grounds. In this note, I study random mutation in one of the simplest models of mutation and adaptation - Fisher's geometric model. I show that random mutation in this model yields a distribution of mutational effects that belongs to the Gumbel type. I also show that the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations in Fisher's model is asymptotically exponential. I confirm these analytic findings with exact computer simulations. These results provide some support for the use of Gumbel-type extreme value theory in studies of adaptation and point to a surprising connection between recent phenotypic- and sequence-based models of adaptation: in both, the distribution of fitness effects among rare beneficial mutations is approximately exponential. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of dis ease, as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leuke mia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n-l)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal trans form to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed associa tion be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regu larities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for ar bitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the ease of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extend ing it to nonlinear and mult {\^{A}}¡variatesituations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed.},

abstract = {1. Although secondary metabolites are recognized as fundamental to the defence of plants against insect and mammalian herbivores, their relative importance compared to other potential defensive plant traits (e.g. physical resistance, gross morphology, life-history, primary chemistry and physiology) are not well understood. 2. We conducted a meta-analysis to answer the question: What types of genetically variable plant traits most strongly predict resistance against herbivores? We performed a comprehensive literature search and obtained 499 separate measurements of the strength of covariation (mea- sured as genetic correlations) between plant traits and herbivore susceptibility – these were extracted from 72 studies involving 19 plant families. 3. Surprisingly, we found no overall association between the concentrations of secondary metabolites and herbivore susceptibility – plant traits other than secondary metabolites most strongly predicted herbivore susceptibility. Specifically, genetic variation in life-history traits (e.g. flowering time, growth rate) consistently exhibited the strongest genetic correlations with susceptibility. Genetic variation in gross morphological traits (e.g. no. branches, plant size) and physical resistance traits (e.g. latex, trichomes) were also frequently correlated with variation in herbivore susceptibility, but these relationships depended on attributes of the herbivores (e.g. feeding guild) and plants (e.g. longevity). 4. These results call into question the conventional wisdom that secondary metabolites are the most important anti-herbivore defence of plants. We propose the hypothesis that herbivores select most strongly on genetic variation in life-history, morphological and physical resistance traits, but the greater pleiotropic effects of genes controlling these traits impose strong con- straints on their evolution. Meanwhile, secondary metabolites could have evolved to be impor- tant defensive mechanisms not because they have the largest effect on herbivores, but because the constraints on their evolution are the weakest.},

abstract = {Animals colonizing cities are exposed to many novel and potentially stressful situations. There is evidence that chronic stress can cause deleterious effects. Hence, wild animals would suffer from city life unless they adjusted their stress response to the conditions in a city. Here we show that European Blackbirds born in a city have a lower stress response than their forest conspecifics. We hand-raised urban and forest-living individuals of that species under identical conditions and tested their corticosterone stress response at an age of 5, 8, and 11 months. The results suggest that the difference is genetically determined, although early developmental effects cannot be excluded. Either way, the results support the idea that urbanization creates a shift in coping styles by changing the stress physiology of animals. The reduced stress response could be ubiquitous and, presumably, necessary for all animals that thrive in ecosystems exposed to frequent anthropogenic disturbances, such as those in urban areas.},

I then describe how con- sidering these other routes to total plant fitness might contribute to current investigations on the evolution of plant defense and floral traits.

We studied three adjacent dialects of white-crowned sparrow songs over a 30-year time span. Urban noise, which is louder at low frequencies, increased during our study period and therefore should have created a selection pressure for songs with higher frequencies. We found that the minimum frequency of songs increased both within and between dialects during the 30-year time span. For example, the dialect with the highest minimum frequency is in the process of replacing another dialect that has lower frequency songs. Songs with the highest minimum frequency were favoured in this environment and should have the most effective transmission properties. We suggest that one mechanism that influences how dialects, and cultural traits in general, are selected and transmitted from one generation to the next is the dialect's ability to be effectively communicated in the local environment.},

abstract = {The genetic basis of floral variation influencing the mating system of Jamaican populations of homostylous Turnera ulmifolia var. angustifolia was investigated using controlled crosses and open-pollinated families. Crosses between plants with large differences in stigma-anther separation and analysis of F2 and backcross generations gave unimodal distributions for all floral characters. No evidence for major gene control of floral variation was obtained and results were contrary to expectations based on segregation at the distyly locus. These data and the continuous distribution of phenotypes among populations indicate that variation is polygenically controlled. Generation means from a cross between plants exhibiting extreme differences in stigma-anther separation could be accounted for by simple biometrical models. An additive-dominance model explained variation in style length while addition of a digenic epistatic parameter was required to account for variation in stamen length and stigma-anther separation. Estimation of repeatabilities and broad-sense heritability indicated genetic variation for style length, stamen length and stigma- anther separation within populations. No genetic correlation was evident for style and stamen length suggesting that selection acting on the mating system of homostylous populations would yield a response.},

Organisms: Second-generation, laboratory-reared stocks of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) from the Misty system, British Columbia, Canada. Experimental fish included pure lake fish, pure inlet fish, and lake-inlet hybrids. Methods: Males of different types (lake, inlet, and hybrid) were paired in aquaria, allowed to build nests, and then exposed to females of all three types (individually and on separate days). The resulting nests were photographed, collected, weighed, and dissected. Results: Lake nests were bulkier than inlet nests, and less often placed on gravel substrate than sand. Hybrid males tended to build intermediate nests but showed very high variation. Some hybrids built lake-like nests and others built inlet-like nests. Conclusions: Nest characteristics show genetic differences between lake and inlet stickleback, and might therefore contribute to any mating isolation.},

Heterozygosity was slightly lower in the more urbanized sites compared to the more rural ones. Low but significant effect of urbanization on genetic differentiation was found, at the site level but not at the nest level, indicative of the geographic scale of urbanization impact and of the potential for local adaptation despite gene flow. Gene-environment association tests identified numerous SNPs with small association scores to urbanization, distributed across the genome, from which a subset of 97 SNPs explained up to 81{\%} of the variance in urbanization, overall suggesting a polygenic response to selection in the urban environment. These findings open stimulating perspectives for broader applications of high-resolution genomic tools on other cities and larger sample sizes to investigate the consistency of the effects of urbanization on the spatial distribution of genetic diversity and the polygenic nature of gene-urbanization association.},

abstract = {Speciation can be viewed as a continuum, potentially divisible into several states: (1) continuous variation within panmictic populations, (2) partially discontinuous variation with minor reproductive isolation, (3) strongly discontinuous variation with strong but reversible reproductive isolation and (4) complete and irreversible reproductive isolation. Research on sticklebacks (Gasterosteidae) reveals factors that influence progress back and forth along this continuum, as well as transitions between the states. Most populations exist in state 1, even though some of these show evidence of disruptive selection and positive assortative mating. Transitions to state 2 seem to usually involve strong divergent selection coupled with at least a bit of geographic separation, such as parapatry (e.g. lake and stream pairs and mud and lava pairs) or allopatry (e.g. different lakes). Transitions to state 3 can occur when allopatric or parapatric populations that evolved under strong divergent selection come into secondary contact (most obviously the sympatric benthic and limnetic pairs), but might also occur between populations that remained in parapatry or allopatry. Transitions to state 4 might be decoupled from these selective processes, because the known situations of complete, or nearly complete, reproductive isolation (Japan Sea and Pacific Ocean pair and the recognized gasterosteid species) are always associated with chromosomal rearrangements and environment-independent genetic incompatibilities. Research on sticklebacks has thus revealed complex and shifting interactions between selection, adaptation, mutation and geography during the course of speciation.},

These changes cause a gain of novel enzyme function, modulated by allelic differences in catalytic rate and gene copy number.

Mechanistic approaches include models that translate environmental conditions into biologically relevant metrics (e.g. potential duration of activity), models that capture environmental sensitivities of survivorship and fecundity, and models that use energetics to link environmental conditions and demography. We compared how two correlative and three mechanistic models predicted the ranges of two species: a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris) and a fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Correlative and mechanistic models performed similarly in predicting current distributions, but mechanistic models predicted larger range shifts in response to climate change.

abstract = {Little is understood about how environmental heterogeneity influences the spatial dynamics of sexual selection. Within human-dominated systems, habitat modification creates environmental heterogeneity that could influence the adaptive value of individual phenotypes. Here, we used the gray catbird to examine if the ecological conditions experienced in the suburban matrix (SM) and embedded suburban parks (SP) influence reproductive strategies and the strength of sexual selection. Our results show that these habitats varied in a key ecological factor, breeding density. Moreover, this ecological factor was closely tied to reproductive strategies such that local breeding density predicted the probability that a nest would contain extra-pair offspring. Partitioning reproductive variance showed that while within-pair success was more important in both habitats, extra-pair success increased the opportunity for sexual selection by 39{\%} at higher breeding densities. Body size was a strong predictor of relative reproductive success and was under directional selection in both habitats. Importantly, our results show that the strength of sexual selection did not differ among habitats at the landscape scale but rather that fine-scale variation in an ecological factor, breeding density, influenced sexual selection on male phenotypes. Here, we document density-dependent sexual selection in a migratory bird and hypothesize that coarse-scale environmental heterogeneity, in this case generated by anthropogenic habitat modification, changed the fine-scale ecological conditions that drove the spatial dynamics of sexual selection.},

abstract = {Urbanization presents unique environmental challenges to human commensal species. The Afrotropical Anopheles gambiae complex contains a number of synanthropic mosquito species that are major vectors of malaria. To examine ongoing cryptic diversification within the complex, we performed reduced representation sequencing on 941 mosquitoes collected across four ecogeographic zones in Cameroon. We find evidence for clear subdivision within An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. - the two most significant malaria vectors in the region. Importantly, in both species rural and urban populations of mosquitoes were genetically differentiated. Genome scans of cryptic subgroups reveal pervasive signatures of selection centered on genes involved in xenobiotic resistance. Notably, a selective sweep containing eight detoxification enzymes is unique to urban mosquitoes that exploit polluted breeding sites. Overall, our study reveals that anthropogenic environmental modification is driving population differentiation and local adaptation in African malaria mosquitoes with potentially significant consequences for malaria epidemiology.},

abstract = {The reduction in genetic diversity in polyploid lineages, formed from whole-genome duplication of a few individuals, can affect their long-term evolutionary poten-tial. Because most polyploids originate multiple times, secondary contact and gene exchange among indepen-dently formed polyploids can create novel genetic combi-nations and reduce the severity of genetic bottlenecks. However, independently originated polyploids may be reproductively isolated from each other due to genetic and chromosomal differences predating the polyploidisation event, or evolving subsequently in the dynamic genomes of young polyploid populations. Here we conducted experi-mental crosses to investigate the phenotype and interfer-tility between two independently originated populations of the allopolyploid Mimulus peregrinus (Phrymaceae). We found that individuals from the two populations are phe-notypically distinct, but that inter-and intrapopulation crosses are not statistically different. Interpopulation crosses produce viable and fertile offspring, although our results suggest the existence of partial reproductive barriers in the form of reduced pollen viability. We found no dif-ference in pollen viability between F1 and F2 generations. In contrast, we detected a reduction in floral and vegetative size, and in the proportion of plants that flowered, between F1 and F2 generations for both intra-and interpopulation crosses. Together, our results indicate that populations of independent origin can partially exchange genes, producing variable offspring, and that the phenotype of M. peregrinus may be unstable in the early generations. Natural selection on genetically based variation may be required for the evolution of more stable and fertile individuals of this nascent allopolyploid.},

abstract = {Pseudo-nitzschia is a marine cosmopolitan genus of chain-forming planktonic diatoms. As for the vast majority of phytoplankton organisms, species identification within this genus mostly relies upon morphological features. Taxa were initially identified based on cell shape and gross morphology of their composite silica cell wall, called the frustule. Yet, observations of the frustule in electron microscopy showed many additional characters for species identification and results of molecular studies have demonstrated that genetically distinct groups might exist within morpho-species. However, these studies have not addressed the biological meaning of these genetic differences. Here, we bridge that gap by comparing ultrastructural features and sequence data (three ribosomal and one plastid marker) of 95 strains with results of mating experiments among these strains. Experiments were performed on two morphologically distinct entities: P. delicatissima and P. pseudodelicatissima. Each of the two entities consisted of multiple genetically distinct and reproductively isolated taxa, all occurring in sympatry: P. delicatissima was composed of three phylogenetic and reproductively distinct groups, whereas P. pseudodelicatissima consisted of up to five. Once these taxa had been defined both genetically and biologically, subtle ultrastructural differences could be detected as well. Our findings not only show that cryptic genetic variants abound in sympatry, but also that they are reproductively isolated and, therefore, biologically distinct units.},

Young leaves of subsp. africana are defended by mutualistic ants, whereas subsp. gracilicaulis satiates herbivores by synchronized leaf production. Subsp. africana possesses hollow internodes and many large foliar nectaries, housing and feeding ants. We detected no genetic introgression between the two subspecies in the contact zone between them. F1 hybrids were present. They were intermediate in phenotype, expressing reduced, nonfunctional but costly myrmecophilic traits. However, they suffered more herbivory than their parents. Hybrids remained small, failing to reach reproductive size, probably due to their maladapted defence phenotype. Hence, there could be a direct link between adaptation to mutualism and reproductive isolation: biotic interactions could be a driver of tropical diversity.},

Methods Data from a national butterfly atlas survey carried out during 1991 2003, with a 10-km grain grid system, were used in these analyses. We used generalized additive models (GAM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) to explore the main environmental correlates (climate and land-cover) of the realized niches of 98 butterfly species. The accuracy of the distribution models (GAMs) was validated by resubstitution and cross-validation approaches, using the area under the curve (AUC) derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Results Predictive accuracies of the 98 individual environment-butterfly models varied from low to very high (cross-validated AUC values 0.48-0.99), with a mean of 0.79. The results of both the GAM and HP analyses were broadly concordant. Most of the variation in butterfly distributions is associated with growing degree-days, mean temperature of the coldest month and cover of built-up area in all six phylogenetic groups (butterfly families). There were no statistically significant differences in predictive accuracy among the different butterfly families. Main conclusions About three-quarters of the distributions of butterfly species in Finland appear to be governed principally by climatic, predominantly temperature-related, factors. This indicates that many butterfly species may respond rapidly to the projected climate change in boreal regions. By determining the ecological niches of multiple species, we can project their range shifts in response to changes in climate and land-cover, and identify species that are particularly sensitive to forecasted global changes.},

abstract = {Morphological consequences of hybridization were studied in a group of three interbreeding species of Darwin's finches on the small Galapagos island of Daphne Major in the inclusive years 1976 to 1992. Geospiza fortis bred with G. scandens and G. fuliginosa. Although interbreeding was always rare ({\textless} 5{\%}), sufficient samples of measurements of hybrids and backcrosses were accumulated for analysis. Five beak and body dimensions and mass were measured, and from these two synthetic (principal-component) traits were constructed. All traits were heritable in two of the interbreeding species (G. fuliginosa were too rare to be analyzed) and in the combined samples of F-1 hybrids and backcrosses to G. fortis. In agreement with expectations from a model of polygenic inheritance, hybrid and backcross classes were generally phenotypically intermediate between the breeding groups that had produced them. Hybridization increased additive genetic and environmental variances, increased heritabilities to a moderate extent, and generally strengthened phenotypic and genetic correlations. New additive genetic variance introduced by hybridization is estimated to be two to three orders of magnitude greater than that introduced by mutation. Enhanced variation facilitates directional evolutionary change, subject to constraints arising from genetic correlations between characters. The Darwin's finch data suggest that these constraints become stronger when species with similar proportions hybridize, but some become weaker when the interbreeding species have different allometries. This latter effect of hybridization, together with an enhancement of genetic variation, facilitates evolutionary change in a new direction.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}The potential for a habitat shift is enhanced when selection against immigrants is augmented by a temporal difference between them and inhabitants of core populations. Genetically mediated changes in flowering time often accompany niche shifts in plants.The possibility that temporal change may arise from plastic responses to novel, stressful, environments rather than from genetic alteration has not been explored. This option is considered here, and it may be quite common.The substantial literature on transplant and common garden experiments shows that invaders of novel habitats are likely to undergo a developmentally based phenological shift. A phenological change in the invading population leads to assortative mating within populations, which in turn facilitates the evolution of local adaptation by the invader. Environmental induction may be the sole contributor to temporal change, or this factor may act in concert with genetic change.Flowering shifts based on developmental responses are immediate, not subject to remediation by gene flow and not affected by a paucity of genetic variation, negative genetic correlations or antagonistic pleiotropy, all of which might constrain phenological evolution.New Phytologist (2009) 183: 661-666doi: 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.02889.x.},

Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.},

This premise leads to a fundamental prediction that has never been tested: Organisms that quickly evolve prezygotic or postzygotic reproductive isolation should have faster rates of speciation than organisms that slowly acquire reproductive isolation. We combined phylogenetic estimates of speciation rates from Drosophila and birds with a method for analyzing interspecific hybridization data to test whether the rate at which individual lineages evolve reproductive isolation predicts their macroevolutionary rate of species formation. We find that some lineages evolve reproductive isolation much more quickly than others, but this variation is decoupled from rates of speciation as measured on phylogenetic trees. For the clades examined here, reproductive isolation--especially intrinsic, postzygotic isolation--does not seem to be the rate-limiting control on macroevolutionary diversification dynamics. These results suggest that factors associated with intrinsic reproductive isolation may have less to do with the tremendous variation in species diversity across the evolutionary tree of life than is generally assumed.},

We compared parents from four populations with their respective F1 hybrids and tested whether (i) transgression can be the source of novel anatomical traits in hybrids; (ii) expression of transgressive traits is more probable for traits with similar values in parents and intermediate for more distinct values, as predicted by theory; and (iii) independent origin of hybrids leads to identical trait expression profiles among populations. We found that anatomical leaf traits can be divided into four categories based on their similarity to parents: intermediate, parental-like, transgressive and non-significant. Contrary to the common view, parental-like trait values were equally important in shaping the hybrid profile, as were intermediate traits. Transgression was revealed in 17/144 cases and concerned mainly cell and tissue sizes. As predicted by theory, we observed transgressive segregation more often when there was little phenotypic divergence, but intermediate values when parental traits were differentiated. It is likely that cell and tissue sizes are phylogenetically more conserved due to stabilising selection, whereas traits such as leaf thickness and volume fraction of the intercellular spaces, showing a consistent intermediate pattern across populations, are more susceptible to directional selection. Hybrid populations showed little similarity in expression profile, with only three traits identically expressed across all populations. Thus local adaptation of parental species and specific genetic background may be of importance.},

We studied pollinator visitation rates and movement patterns in experimental arrays of irises at two sites within a Louisiana iris hybrid zone. Arrays contained single-flowered stems of red-flowered Iris ful6a, blue-flowered I. hexagona, and purple-flow-ered F 1 hybrids. At one site, where I. hexagona was the only wild-growing iris, queen bumble bees were the most common pollinator, and the rank order of pollinator visit rates was I. hexagona $\backslash$F 1 $\backslash$I. ful6a. At a second site, where I. ful6a predominated in the wild, hummingbirds were the most common pollinators, and this order was reversed: I. hexagona B F 1 BI. ful6a. Thus, at both sites, the naturally occurring iris was visited most frequently and F 1 flowers were visited more frequently than the non-native species. Pollinators used both long-distance and short-distance cues to discriminate among flowers, and differences in visit rates seemed to be based on differences in the ease of access to pollen and nectar rewards on flowers of different size. Analysis of movement patterns between flowers showed that pollinators were more likely to make parental-F 1 transitions than heterospecific transitions. These data suggest that pollinator behavior acts as a partial barrier to initial hybridization, although this barrier largely breaks down after F 1 formation. Our results help to explain the existence of many introgressed populations of Louisiana iris, despite the fact that F 1 s are extremely rare in the wild.},

abstract = {Urbanization leads to homogenization of avian communities through local extinction of rare bird species and increasing numbers of the same common urban bird species over large geographical areas. Successful city birds often persist through some sort of behavioural plasticity that helps them survive and reproduce close to humans, in built-up areas, with all the typical urban feasts and hazards. In this review, I address whether behavioural plasticity of the acoustic phenotype can be an additional factor in explaining which species end up as urban survivors. Anthropogenic noise has been shown to negatively affect avian distribution and reproduction, especially for species that rely on relatively low-frequency songs for mediating territorial conflicts and attracting partners for mating. Spectral differences between songs of city and forest populations of the same species and correlations between individual song frequency use and local noise levels suggest that many successful city species shift song frequency upward under noisy urban conditions. Experimental evidence has confirmed the ability of several species to show rapid spectral adjustments as well as perceptual benefits of singing at higher frequency in noisy habitats. However, empirical evidence of fitness benefits for birds showing the ability and tendency of noise-dependent spectral adjustment is still lacking. Furthermore, depending on the species and the underlying mechanism for spectral change, there may also be fitness costs through a compromise on signal function. These two aspects are only two of many remaining avenues for future studies. The acoustic phenotype of urban birds provides a great model system to study fundamental processes such as causes and consequences of environmentally induced signal changes, 'cultural assimilation', and the relationship between phenotypic and genotypic evolution. Furthermore, the current and expected rate of urbanization remains high at a global scale, which will lead to further spread in time and space of artificially elevated noise levels. This should guarantee the continued interest of scientists, politicians and conservationists for many years ahead. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Polyploid evolution is often considered a mechanism of instant speciation; yet the establishment of rare tetraploids within diploid populations may be constrained by a frequency-dependent mating disadvantage (minority cytotype exclusion principle). I tested this hypothesis using experimental populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) that contained different proportions of tetraploids and diploids. Fitness, measured as total seed production over the entire flowering season, was calculated from a census of flower number and estimates of ovule number per flower and proportion of seed set per fruit. The fitness of tetraploids relative to diploids was frequency dependent, increasing from 0.4, when tetraploids were rare, to 0.7 when at 50{\%} and 1.15 when they were in the majority (67{\%}). This pattern exists because of a negative relationship between tetraploid frequency and seed set per fruit in diploids. Seed set in tetraploids was independent of cytotype frequency. The frequency-independent effect in tetraploids reflects higher assortative mating, partly because of non-random patterns of bee visitation. Bees visited a disproportionately high number of diploid inflorescences; however, the proportion of successive flights between tetraploids increased above random expectations as the frequency of tetraploids decreased. These results provide the first experimental test of frequency-dependent fitness in diploid-polyploid mixtures and suggest an important role for more gradual, population processes governing the evolution of polyploidy in natural populations.},

abstract = {Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of tooth traits has been reported to be increased in Down syndrome patients as well as hybrids between chromosomal races of the house mouse differing in several Robertsonian (Rb) fusions. Developmental stability, assessed by FA, is thus thought to be impaired by spontaneous chromosomal abnormality or by chromosomal heterozygosity. Although the effect of a single fusion on developmental stability could theoretically be expected, it has never been documented. Crosses involving two chromosomal races of the house mouse diverging for one Rb fusion were performed to assess developmental stability in parental homozygous races as well as in their hybrids. Moreover, the occurrence of a spontaneous chromosomal mutation (WART type-b) allowed us to study the instantaneous effect of such a translocation on developmental stability. No difference in fluctuating asymmetry levels was detected among the groups considered in this study. This result suggested that a single stable or spontaneous balanced structural rearrangement did not inherently disturb developmental stability. In addition, the differential effect on developmental stability of one versus many heterozygous Rb fusions highlights the role of their quantitative accumulation in the disruption of coadaptation in chromosomal hybrids.},

abstract = {The early fossil record of terrestrial arthropod herbivory consists of two pulses. The first pulse was concentrated during the latest Silurian to Early Devonian (417 to 403 Ma), and consists of the earliest evidence for consumption of sporangia and stems (and limited fungivore borings). Herbivorization of most of these tissues was rapid, representing 0 to 20 million-year (m.y.) lags from the earliest occurrences of these organs in the fossil record to their initial consumption (Phase 1). For approximately the next 75 m.y., there was a second, more histologically varied origination and expansion of roots, leaves, wood and seeds, whose earliest evidence for herbivorization occurred from the Middle-Late Mississippian boundary to the Middle Pennsylvanian (327 to 309 Ma). The appearance of this second herbivory pulse during the later Paleozoic (Phase 2) is accompanied by major lags of 98 to 54 m.y. between times of appearance of each of the four organ and tissue types and their subsequent herbivory. Both pulses provide a context for three emerging questions. First is an explanation for the contrast between the near instantaneous consumption of plant tissues during Phase 1, versus the exceptionally long lags between the earliest occurrences of plant tissues and their subsequent herbivorization during Phase 2. Second is the identity of arthropod herbivores for both phases. Third is the cause behind the overwhelming targeting of seed-fern plant hosts during Phase 2. Regardless of the answers to these questions, the trace fossil record of plant-arthropod associations provides primary ecological data that remain unaddressed by the body-fossil record alone.},

abstract = {Interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear gene products that underlie eukaryotic energy metabolism can cause the fitness effects of mutations in one genome to be conditional on variation in the other genome. In ectotherms, the effects of these interactions are likely to depend upon the thermal environment, because increasing temperature accelerates molecular rates. We find that temperature strongly modifies the pleiotropic phenotypic effects of an incompatible interaction between a Drosophila melanogaster polymorphism in the nuclear-encoded, mitochondrial tyrosyl-transfer (t)RNA synthetase and a D. simulans polymorphism in the mitochondrially encoded tRNA(Tyr). The incompatible mitochondrial-nuclear genotype extends development time, decreases larval survivorship, and reduces pupation height, indicative of decreased energetic performance. These deleterious effects are ameliorated when larvae develop at 16 degrees and exacerbated at warmer temperatures, leading to complete sterility in both sexes at 28 degrees . The incompatible genotype has a normal metabolic rate at 16 degrees but a significantly elevated rate at 25 degrees , consistent with the hypothesis that inefficient energy metabolism extends development in this genotype at warmer temperatures. Furthermore, the incompatibility decreases metabolic plasticity of larvae developed at 16 degrees , indicating that cooler development temperatures do not completely mitigate the deleterious effects of this genetic interaction. Our results suggest that the epistatic fitness effects of metabolic mutations may generally be conditional on the thermal environment. The expression of epistatic interactions in some environments, but not others, weakens the efficacy of selection in removing deleterious epistatic variants from populations and may promote the accumulation of incompatibilities whose fitness effects will depend upon the environment in which hybrids occur.},

abstract = {1 Theoretical models indicate that coexistence of diploid and polyploid individuals in sympatric populations is unlikely when mating is random among cytotypes and hybrids are inviable. However, coexistence may be facilitated by prezygotic isolating mechanisms that reduce intercytotype mating and increase assortative mating. 2 We examined the ecological factors regulating intercytotype mating in Chamerion (formerly Epilobium) angustifolium by measuring floral morphology, flowering synchrony and insect foraging preferences in a mixed population within a diploid-tetraploid contact zone. We also calculated the minimum rate of between-cytotype mating from estimates of the frequency of triploid offspring. 3 Diploids had significantly shorter and narrower petals as well as shorter styles than tetraploids. Inflorescences were significantly taller in tetraploids than diploids, but the mean number of open flowers per inflorescence did not differ. Diploid and tetraploid flowering periods overlapped by 51{\%}, with diploid stems flowering earlier. 4 In a plot of 20 diploid and 28 tetraploid stems that were flowering simultaneously, only 26{\%} of all bee flights were between flowers on different stems. Of the total flights between inflorescences, only 15{\%} were between different cytotypes. The combined effects of flowering asynchrony and insect foraging reduced the opportunities for intercytotype mating from 49{\%} expected if mating is random to about 2{\%} of the total number of pollinator flights. 5 A computer simulation indicated that the deficiency of pollinator flights between cytotypes was due largely to the spatial structure of cytotypes and limited pollinator flight distances within the observation plot. The frequency of triploid offspring produced during the period when both cytotypes were in flower was 6.6{\%}, similar to the proportion of flights observed between flowers on different cytotypes (4{\%}). 6 The results indicate that flowering phenology and insect behaviour (as influenced by clonal structure) have a significant effect on prezygotic mating isolation and triploid production, and may contribute to the maintenance of mixed cytotype populations in Chamerion angustifolium.},

abstract = {• The ecological and adaptive significance of plant polyploidization is not well understood and no clear pattern of association between polyploid frequency and environment has emerged. Climatic factors are expected to predict cytotype distribution. However, the relationship among climate, cytotype distribution and variation of abiotic stress tolerance traits has rarely been examined. • Here, we use flow cytometry and root-tip squashes to examine the cytotype distribution in the temperate annual grass Brachypodium distachyon in 57 natural populations distributed across an aridity gradient in the Iberian Peninsula. We further investigate the link between environmental aridity, ploidy, and variation of drought tolerance and drought avoidance (flowering time) traits. • Distribution of diploids (2n = 10) and allotetraploids (2n = 30) in this species is geographically structured throughout its range in the Iberian Peninsula, and is associated with aridity gradients. Importantly, after controlling for geographic and altitudinal effects, the link between aridity and polyploidization occurrence persisted. Water-use efficiency varied between ploidy levels, with tetraploids being more efficient in the use of water than diploids under water-restricted growing conditions. • Our results indicate that aridity is an important predictor of polyploid occurrence in B. distachyon, suggesting a possible adaptive origin of the cytotype segregation.},

abstract = {Similar phenotypes do not always imply similar genotypes. In species distributed over a broad latitudinal range, geographical variation in morphological and life-history traits may reflect very different relations between genotypic and environmental effects on these traits. Patterns of selection among latitudinally separated sites may minimize phenotypic differences in life-history traits but promote phenotypic differences in form. Thus, for example, latitudinal variation in temperature often leads to genetically based metabolic differences that minimize differences in growth rate among populations at different latitudes (countergradient variation). However, variation in habitat experienced by the same populations may promote genetically based differences in shell form (cogradient variation). Few attempts have been made to assess simultaneously such mosaic effects of natural selection on the genetic basis of variation in both morphological and life-history traits among geographically separated populations. I quantified the extent to which widely separated populations of the rocky shore marine gastropod Bembicium vittatum exhibited genetic differences in shell shape, shell pattern, and growth rate. Bembicium vittatum occurs naturally at only three widely separated locations on the Western Australian coast. Individuals were transplanted from all three locations to a latitudinally intermediate site, where they were released in different pairwise combinations and allowed to reproduce. Fl offspring from crosses between same- or different-source parents were identified using allozyme markers. When grown in a common environment, offspring from same-source parents exhibited similar differences in shell shape and pattern, but dramatic differences in growth rates, compared to native populations. Genetic variation therefore exists for all three traits. Growth rates in the common environment were positively correlated with latitude of the source population, confirming the existence of countergradient variation for growth associated with metabolic compensation. In addition, for both shell shape and growth rate, hybrids exhibited phenotypes roughly midway between the same-source parents, suggesting that genetic differences have a large additive component. In contrast, when one parent had pigmented spots, the offspring also had spots, suggesting a strong dominance component to the genetic basis of shell pattern. Genetic differences therefore yield different morphological phenotypes but similar life-history phenotypes, among latitudinally distant populations, and confirm a pattern of mosaic evolution in B, vittatum.},

Understanding the mechanisms for mating–defence interactions promises to broaden our understanding of how ecological processes can generate these two rich sources of angiosperm diversity. Here, I review current research on the role of herbivory as a driver of mating system evolution, and the role of mating systems in the evolution of defence strategies. I outline different ecological mechanisms and processes that could generate these coevolutionary patterns, and summarize theoretical and empirical support for each.

abstract = {Worldwide urbanization and the ongoing rise of urban noise levels form a major threat to living conditions in and around cities [1-4]. Urban environments typically homogenize animal communities, and this results, for example, in the same few bird species' being found everywhere [5, 6]. Insight into the behavioral strategies of the urban survivors may explain the sensitivity of other species to urban selection pressures. Here, we show that songs that are important to mate attraction and territory defense have significantly diverged in great tits (Parus major), a very successful urban species. Urban songs were shorter and sung faster than songs in forests, and often concerned atypical song types. Furthermore, we found consistently higher minimum frequencies in ten out of ten city-forest comparisons from London to Prague and from Amsterdam to Paris. Anthropogenic noise is most likely a dominant factor driving these dramatic changes [7-9]. These data provide the most consistent evidence supporting the acoustic-adaptation hypothesis since it was postulated in the early seventies [10-12]. At the same time, they reveal a behavioral plasticity that may be key to urban success and the lack of which may explain detrimental effects on bird communities that live in noisy urbanized areas or along highways. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

I develop a simple model demonstrating how the opportunity for selection varies with interaction strength, and then use the relationship between the maximum value of the selection differential and the opportunity for selection (Arnold {\&} Wade 1984) to evaluate how selection differentials vary in relation to species interaction strength. This model predicts an initial deceleration and then an accelerating increase in the intensity of selection with increasing strength of antagonistic interactions and with decreasing strength of mutualistic interactions. Empirical data from several studies provide support for this model. These results further support an evolutionary mechanism for some striking patterns of evolutionary diversification including the latitudinal species gradient, and should be relevant to studies of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {The latest previous comprehensive review of allelopathy (Rice, 1974) covered research done primarily prior to 1973. There have been numerous reviews published in recent years on specific phases of allelopathy (see III), but most of them covered research results published primarily through 1972 also. This review has been restricted, therefore, largely to research conducted subsequent to 1972, except for background information and significant papers overlooked in previous reviews. There has been almost an exponential increase in the rate of publication of papers concerned with allelopathy. Research has been particularly active in relation to the roles of allelopathy in agriculture, forestry, phytopathology, patterning of vegetation, algal succession, and old-field succession. Our increasing knowledge of the conditions under which certain crop residues cause allelopathic effects to subsequent crops should enable us soon to guard against such effects. We are on the threshold of breeding crop plants that will inhibit the chief weeds in a given area through allelopathic action, and thus decrease the need for synthetic weed killers. Our understanding of allelopathic interactions of various plant species has already been used advantageously in reforestation, and future developments are very encouraging. Our increasing knowledge of allelopathy is aiding greatly in our understanding of many ecological phenomena, such as succession and patterning of vegetation. Evidence is mounting that inhibition of nitrification increases as succession progresses toward the climax vegetation, at least in many vegetation types. This leads to a decrease in the loss of nitrogen. Addition of inhibitors to arable lands to prevent nitrification has proved to be valuable in preventing loss of nitrogen and in increasing crop yields. There has been a rapid advance in our knowledge of mechanisms of action of known allelopathic compounds, at increasingly more fundamental levels. We have known for several years, for example, that some of these compounds inhibit uptake of various minerals, but have not known the mechanism of the action. Recent research indicates this may be due, at least in part, to inhibition of a plasma membrane ATPase that is involved with ion absorption. A thorough knowledge of mechanisms of action of allelochemics is essential to our overall understanding and appreciation of the field of allelopathy.

The tension between divergence and convergence has been a major focus of this experiment. I summarize analyses of competitive fitness, correlated responses to different environments, cell morphology, the capacity to use a previously untapped resource, mutation rates, genomic changes, and within-population polymorphisms. These analyses reveal convergence, divergence, and often a complicated mix thereof. Complications include concordance in the direction of evolutionary change with sustained quantitative variation among populations, and the potential for a given trait to exhibit divergence on one timescale and convergence on another. Despite these complications, which also occur in nature, experiments provide a powerful way to study evolutionary convergence based on analyzing replicate lineages that experience the same environment.},

Additional barcodes need to be evaluated to improve the level of discrimination between plant species. Because of their well-studied taxonomy and extreme diversity, we used Chinese Lysimachia (Myrsinaceae) species to test the performance of core barcodes (rbcL and matK) and two additional candidate barcodes (trnH-psbA and the nuclear ribosomal ITS); 97 accessions from four subgenus representing 34 putative Lysimachia species were included in this study. And many closely related species pairs in subgen. Lysimachia were covered to detect their discriminatory power. The inefficiency of rbcL and matK alone or combined in closely related plant groups was validated in this study. TrnH-psbA combined with rbcL + matK did not yet perform well in Lysimachia groups.

abstract = {Assessments of population genetic structure and diversity can be of value in formulating management plans for threatened species. Using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers, we found evidence of significant genetic structure among black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) sampled at three spatial scales. highly isolated (1500-1900 km apart) populations were strongly divergent (F-ST = 0.242-0.323), whereas populations more proximal (less than or equal to 465 km apart) although currently isolated, exhibited far less divergence (F-ST = 0.019). A considerable proportion (80{\%}) of total genetic diversity was due to differences among individuals within populations, although differences among populations (8{\%}) also wee significant. At the scale of sub-populations (local populations 15-50 km apart), differentiation was generally moderate (F-ST = 0.058). Our estimates of Nei's genetic distance for sub-populations (0.014) approximated (mean = 0.044) those obtained in other studies that have assessed differentiation between snake populations based on variation in allozymes. The majority (ca. 86{\%}) of total genetic variance across five sub-populations was attributable to differences among individuals, although differences among sub-populations (ca. 13{\%}) also were significant. We found little evidence of genetic structure (F-ST = 0.006) between pairs of hibernacula, our finest spatial scale (samples 1-2 km apart), if they were located in natural habitats. In contrast, a pair of hibernacula sampled in an urban area exhibited genetic structure equivalent to some sub-population differences (F-ST = 0.039), suggesting interrupted gene flow related to urban development. Our results have direct implications for ranking populations in terms of their conservation value and the genetic management of threatened snakes.},

These particular combinations may influence hybrid fitness and the evolutionary trajectory of a hybrid zone. Here, a hybrid zone between Penstemon newberryi and Penstemon davidsonii along an elevational gradient was examined, and physiological traits of parents and hybrids were measured in their native environment and a common garden. Gas exchange rates of nine different crosses were also measured. Alpine P. davidsonii had less negative pre-dawn water potential and lower water use efficiency (WUE) than its montane relative P. newberryi in a common garden and in field measurements. The species difference in WUE was attributable to lower conductance in P. newberryi in the field, but to a higher photosynthetic rate in this species in the common garden. The alpine species took less time to produce mature fruits and reached maximum photosynthetic rate at a lower temperature. Natural hybrids were intermediate for most characters. F(1) hybrids had lower conductance than progeny of natural hybrids. The intermediate WUE of natural hybrids may be one factor that allows them to persist in intermediate environments. Comparisons of different crosses suggest that the genotypic composition of hybrids influences their physiological performance.},

Yet its evolutionary significance remains controversial, especially in regard to whether and how it impacts diversification and speciation.

We also discuss the latest empirical support for each of these evolutionary pathways to diversification and identify potentially profitable areas for future research.

Negative epistatic interactions between genes from different parental genomes decrease the fitness of hybrids and can limit gene flow between species. However, little is known about the number and genome-wide distribution of genetic incompatibilities separating species. To detect interacting genes, we perform a high-resolution genome scan for linkage disequilibrium between unlinked genomic regions in naturally occurring hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We estimate that hundreds of pairs of genomic regions contribute to reproductive isolation between these species, despite them being recently diverged. Many of these incompatibilities are likely the result of natural or sexual selection on hybrids, since intrinsic isolation is known to be weak. Patterns of genomic divergence at these regions imply that genetic incompatibilities play a significant role in limiting gene flow even in young species.},

abstract = {Because herbivores can move away from plants of low quality, induced resistance should affect the spatial distribution of herbivore damage (or herbivores) within or among plants. We used a spatially explicit simulation model and data from a field experiment to examine the effect of induced resistance on the distribution of herbivores and their damage among plants within a population. The model is appropriate only for rapid (as opposed to delayed) induced resistance, assumes that resistance affects herbivore behavior but not performance, and assumes no interplant communication. It is also appropriate only for induced resistance that decays in the absence of herbivore damage. The simulation tracks herbivores on a linear array of plants or plant parts with reflecting boundaries and allows manipulation of the timing of induced resistance and the initial distribution of herbivores. Our model suggests that increasing tags and thresholds for the production of induced resistance causes increasing aggregation of herbivores and their damage, but in the absence of either a lag or a threshold, induced resistance can lead to an even distribution of herbivores. The formation of even or aggreated distributions of herbivores depends not on initial distributions, but on the characteristics of the induced resistance. In the field experiment, we measured the degree of aggregation of Mexican bean beetle larvae among plants within experimental soybean populations consisting of soybean varieties that had no resistance (low constitutive, low inducible resistance), induced resistance (and low constitutive resistance), or constitutive resistance (and low inducible resistance). In general agreement with qualitative predictions of the model, we found that larvae on soybean varieties with induced resistance remained significantly more aggregated than larvae on varieties with no or high constitutive resistance.},

Differences in morphological characters are overlapping and thus are delimited in their taxonomic value, even when behavioral and reproductive specializations are apparent. Our enzyme electrophoretic study included 7 geographic populations of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and 7 of the biotype molestus from several European countries. For comparison, 5 populations of Culex quinquefasciatus from Asia, Africa, and North America were examined. The aim was an assessment of the extent of genetic differences between local populations of the biotypes pipiens and molestus versus the degree of differentiation between geographic populations of both groups. Culex torrentium, Cx. modestus, Culex stigmatosoma, and Culex territans were studied for comparison as taxonomical well-defined species. The population genetic analyses revealed much higher genetic distances between local populations of Cx. pipiens biotype pipiens and Cx. pipiens biotype molestus compared to the low differentiation between geographic populations within each taxon. The UPGMA analysis and F-statistics position the geographic populations in discrete monophyletic clusters. Gene flow between local populations of the biotypes pipiens and molestus could be shown to be lower than gene flow between geographically distant populations within each of the 2 groups, leading to the conclusion that Cx. pipiens biotype molestus could be a distinct taxon. Culex quinquefasciatus could be diagnosed as genetically well separated, in particular by the diagnostic enzyme marker MDH (NADP). Two genetic enzyme markers were identified to differentiate Cx. torrentium from Cx. pipiens s.l. Culex modestus, Cx. stigmatosoma, and Cx. territans showed considerable genetic distances to the species of the Culex pipiens complex and between each other, and several genetic markers could be identified.},

We investigated patterns of convergent and divergent evolution of Caribbean Anolis lizards. These lizards diversified independently on each of the islands of the Greater Antilles, producing the same set of habitat specialists on each island. Using a phylogenetic comparative framework, we examined patterns of morphological convergence in five functionally distinct sets of morphological characters: body size, body shape, head shape, lamella number, and sexual size dimorphism. We find evidence for convergence among members of the habitat specialist types for each of these five datasets. Furthermore, the patterns of convergence differ among at least four of the five datasets; habitat specialists that are similar for one set of characters are often greatly different for another. This suggests that the habitat specialist niches into which these anoles have evolved are multidimensional, involving several distinct and independent aspects of morphology.},

abstract = {In the face of hybridization, species integrity can only be maintained through post-zygotic isolating barriers (PIBs). PIBs need not only be intrinsic (i.e. hybrid inviability and sterility caused by developmental incompatibilities), but also can be extrinsic due to the hybrid's intermediate phenotype falling between the parental niches. For example, in migratory species, hybrid fitness might be reduced as a result of intermediate migration pathways and reaching suboptimal wintering grounds. Here, we test this idea by comparing the juvenile to adult survival probabilities as well as the wintering grounds of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) and their hybrids using stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen (delta15N) in feathers developed at the wintering site. Our result supports earlier observations of largely segregated wintering grounds of the two parental species. The isotope signature of hybrids clustered with that of pied flycatchers. We argue that this pattern can explain the high annual survival of hybrid flycatchers. Hence, dominant expression of the traits of one of the parental species in hybrids may substantially reduce the ecological costs of hybridization.},

Results of the analytical studies were compared to data on the quantities of trace metals known to be discharged by industry into the catchments of each Bay. This allowed an evaluation of the indicator ability of the mussel without the need for multiple analyses of water samples. The results suggest that the mussel is capable of acting as an efficient time-integrated indicator of zinc, cadmium and lead over a wide variety of environmental conditions. Although additional variables may remain to be investigated, the mussel is recommended as an alternative to the analysis of water and sediments. With further development this organism may also be useful for monitoring industrial effluent characteristics at the discharge site, allowing rapid, reliable and inexpensive control of water quality. In contrast, the mussel is of doubtful use as an indicator of copper; other indicator types such as macroalgae may be better-suited to the study of this element.},

abstract = {Measuring natural selection has been a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology for more than a century, and techniques developed in the last 20 yr have provided relatively simple means for biologists to do so. Many of these techniques, however, share a common limitation: when applied to phenotypic data, environmentally induced covariances between traits and fitness can lead to biased estimates of selection and misleading predictions about evolutionary change. Utilizing estimates of breeding values instead of phenotypic data with these methods can eliminate environmentally induced bias, although this approach is more difficult to implement. Despite this potential limitation to phenotypic methods and the availability of a potential solution, little empirical evidence exists on the extent of environmentally induced bias in phenotypic estimates of selection. In this article, we present a method for detecting bias in phenotypic estimates of selection and demonstrate its use with three independent data sets. Nearly 25{\%} of the phenotypic selection gradients estimated from our data are biased by environmental covariances. We find that bias caused by environmental covariances appears mainly to affect quantitative estimates of the strength of selection based on phenotypic data and that the magnitude of these biases is large. As our estimates of selection are based on data from spatially replicated field experiments, we suggest that our findings on the prevalence of bias caused by environmental covariances are likely to be conservative.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that the invasive success of Centaurea maculosa may be related to its stronger allelopathic effects on native North American species than on related European species, one component of the "novel weapons" hypothesis. Other research indicates that C. maculosa plants from the invasive range in North America have evolved to be larger and better competitors than conspecifics from the native range in Europe, a component of the "evolution of increased competitive ability" hypothesis. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but this evidence sets the stage for comparing the relative importance of evolved competitive ability to inherent competitive traits. In a competition experiment with a large number of C. maculosa populations, we found no difference in the competitive effects of C. maculosa plants from North America and Europe on other species. However, both North American and European C. maculosa were much better competitors against plants native to North America than congeners native to Romania, collected in areas where C. maculosa is also native. These results are consistent with the novel weapons hypothesis. But, in a second experiment using just one population from North America and Europe, and where North American and European species were collected from a broader range of sites, competitive interactions were weaker overall, and the competitive effects of C. maculosa were slightly stronger against European species than against North American species. Also consistent with the novel weapons hypothesis, (+/-)-catechin had stronger effects on native North American species than on native European species in two experiments. Our results suggest that the regional composition of the plant communities being invaded by C. maculosa may be more important for invasive success than the evolution of increased size and competitive ability.},

As a result, many species are not able to shift their ranges in response to climate change and will likely need to adapt in situ to changing climate conditions. Consequently, a prudent strategy to maintain the ability of populations to adapt is to focus conservation efforts on areas where levels of intraspecific variation are high. By doing so, the potential for an evolutionary response to environmental change is maximized. Here, we use modeling approaches in conjunction with environmental variables to model species distributions and patterns of genetic and morphological variation in seven Ecuadorian amphibian, bird, and mammal species. We then used reserve selection software to prioritize areas for conservation based on intraspecific variation or species-level diversity. Reserves selected using species richness and complementarity showed little overlap with those based on genetic and morphological variation. Priority areas for intraspecific variation were mainly located along the slopes of the Andes and were largely concordant among species, but were not well represented in existing reserves. Our results imply that in order to maximize representation of intraspecific variation in reserves, genetic and morphological variation should be included in conservation prioritization.},

abstract = {Plants respond to insect herbivores with changes in physical and chemical traits, both locally and systemically, in leaves and flowers. Such phenotypic changes may influence the behaviour of every community member that interacts with the plant. Here, we address effects of plant responses to eggs and subsequent herbivory by caterpillars on plant-mediated interactions with pollinators and consequences for plant fitness. Using a common garden set-up, we have investigated responses of Brassica nigra plants to herbivore exposure from egg deposition onwards throughout larval development. We quantified effects of infestation by the specialist Pieris brassicae on: 1. behaviour of pollinators; 2. volatile emission and 3. timing and number of seeds produced. Egg deposition and folivory did not influence visitation by pollinators to plots of infested or control plants. Effects of herbivore infestation on both pollinator visitation and volatile emission were observed only at a later stage, when caterpillars were feeding on the flowers. Remarkably, before eggs had hatched, infested plants accelerated seed production. The caterpillars that developed from the eggs fed on flowers but not on seeds and thus seed production prior to herbivory on flowers safeguarded reproductive output. The results of this study show that early plant investments in reproduction can successfully prevent consumption of expensive reproductive tissues. By accelerating seed production, plants prevented consumption of flowers and effectively defended themselves against the herbivores.},

The locations of these settlements effectively eliminate all non-urban climatic influences. The results are compared with previously published data. The analysis shows the heat island intensity under cloudless skies to be related to the inverse of the regional windspeed, and the logarithm of the population. A simple model is derived which incorporates these controls. In agreement with an extension of Summers' model the heat island appears to be approximately proportional to the fourth root of the population. With calm and clear conditions the relation is shown to hold remarkably well for North American settlements, and in a slightly modified form, for European towns and cities. },

abstract = {Plants and their associated insect herbivores, represent more than 50{\%} of all known species on earth. The first step in understanding the mechanisms generating and maintaining this important component of biodiversity is to identify plant-herbivore associations. In this study we determined insect-host plant associations for an entire guild of insect herbivores using plant DNA extracted from insect gut contents. Over two years, in a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica (La Selva Biological Station), we recorded the full diet breadth of rolled-leaf beetles, a group of herbivores that feed on plants in the order Zingiberales. Field observations were used to determine the accuracy of diet identifications using a three-locus DNA barcode (rbcL, trnH-psbA and ITS2). Using extraction techniques for ancient DNA, we obtained high-quality sequences for two of these loci from gut contents (rbcL and ITS2). Sequences were then compared to a comprehensive DNA barcode library of the Zingiberales. The rbcL locus identified host plants to family (success/sequence = 58.8{\%}) and genus (success/sequence = 47{\%}). For all Zingiberales except Heliconiaceae, ITS2 successfully identified host plants to genus (success/sequence = 67.1{\%}) and species (success/sequence = 61.6{\%}). Kindt's sampling estimates suggest that by collecting ca. four individuals representing each plant-herbivore interaction, 99{\%} of all host associations included in this study can be identified to genus. For plants that amplified ITS2, 99{\%} of the hosts can be identified to species after collecting at least four individuals representing each interaction. Our study demonstrates that host plant identifications at the species-level using DNA barcodes are feasible, cost-effective, and reliable, and that reconstructing plant-herbivore networks with these methods will become the standard for a detailed understanding of these interactions.},

The identity of parental, hybrid, and backcross genotypes was confirmed using allozyme markers. The data were used to test for hybrid (H) intermediacy in morphological traits that differentiate the two parental taxa (acronyms A and N are used for C acanthoides and C nutans, respectively) and to determine patterns of variation on the same traits among the four classes of backcross plants (NH, HN, AH, and HA, seed X pollen parent, respectively). Canonical multivariate analysis indicated that in general, F1 hybrids had intermediate morphologies compared with parental genotypes, although differences were observed among characters with respect to the degree of morphological intermediacy of hybrids. The backcrosses were divided into two groups, i.e., those backcrossed with C acanthoides (AH and HA) and those with C nutans (NH and HN). However, backcrosses also showed considerable morphological overlap with F1 hybrids. These results exemplify the utility of joint comparisons of morphology and genotypic constitution (allozymes) in the hybridization studies, and they emphasize the limitations in describing hybrid classes solely by morphological criteria.},

Here, we analyze this scenario mathematically, focusing on the evolution of a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (DMI) between populations. Our results identify a potential problem with Muller's scenario: adaptation to identical environments can often involve substitution of the same alleles, precluding formation of a hybrid incompatibility. We show that the probability of evolving a DMI falls as selection coefficients among beneficial alleles become less similar. The reason is that if one locus is under much stronger selection than the other, that locus is much more likely to experience a substitution first in both populations. This precludes the development of a DMI, which requires different substitutions in the two populations.},

We address this issue using candidate genes for behavioural traits that are expected to play a role in such colonization events. We identified and genotyped 16 polymorphisms in candidate genes for circadian rhythms, harm avoidance and migratory and exploratory behaviour in 12 paired urban and rural populations of the blackbird Turdus merula across the Western Palaearctic. An exonic microsatellite in the SERT gene, a candidate gene for harm avoidance behaviour, exhibited a highly significant association with habitat type in an analysis conducted across all populations. Genetic divergence at this locus was consistent in 10 of the 12 population pairs; this contrasts with previously reported stochastic genetic divergence between these populations at random markers. Our results indicate that behavioural traits related to harm avoidance and associated with the SERT polymorphism experience selection pressures during most blackbird urbanization events. These events thus appear to be influenced by homogeneous adaptive processes in addition to previously reported demographic founder events.},

We investigate the genetic basis of floral differences between two closely related plant taxa with highly divergent mating systems, Mimulus guttatus (large-flowered outcrosser) and M. nasutus (small-flowered selfer). We had previously constructed a framework genetic linkage map of the hybrid genome containing 174 markers spanning approximately 1800 cM on 14 linkage groups. In this study, we analyze the genetics of 16 floral, reproductive, and vegetative characters measured in a large segregating M. nasutus x M. guttatus F2 population (N = 526) and in replicates of the parental lines and F1 hybrids. Phenotypic analyses reveal strong genetic correlations among floral traits and epistatic breakdown of male and female fertility traits in the F2 hybrids. We use multitrait composite interval mapping to jointly locate and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying interspecific differences in seven floral traits. We identified 24 floral QTLs, most of which affected multiple traits. The large number of QTLs affecting each trait (mean = 13, range = 11-15) indicates a strikingly polygenic basis for floral divergence in this system. In general, QTL effects are small relative to both interspecific differences and environmental variation within genotypes, ruling out QTLs of major effect as contributors to floral divergence between M. guttatus and M. nasutus. QTLs show no pattern of directional dominance. Floral characters associated with pollinator attraction (corolla width) and self-pollen deposition (stigma-anther distance) share several pleiotropic or linked QTLs, but unshared QTLs may have allowed selfing to evolve independently from flower size. We discuss the polygenic nature of divergence between M. nasutus and M. guttatus in light of theoretical work on the evolution of selfing, genetics of adaptation, and maintenance of variation within populations.},

It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes. This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1. Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. (See Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details about the specific language the IPCC uses to communicate uncertainty) The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in the Technical Summary.

After one growing season, redear ♀ × green ♂ hybrids showed the greatest growth (average weight gain) followed by that of green ♀ × redear ♂ hybrids, redear and green sunfish. At the end of the second growing season, green ♀ × redear ♂hybrids had the highest average weight followed by redear ♀ × green ♂ hybrid, redear and green sunfish. Specific activities of different enzymes (malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucosephosphate isomerase and phosphoglucomutase) in one or more tissues (skeletal muscle, liver, and eye) also differed among the progeny classes. No significant correlation was observed between growth and the tissue levels of enzyme locus expression. Enzyme activity levels of hybrids tended to be intermediate to those of parental species, whereas growth rates of each hybrid exceeded parental growth rates.

The evolutionarily novel urban habitat provides an excellent opportunity to study this role for song in the initial steps of population divergence associated with contrasting habitats close to home. In this study, we show spectral and temporal song divergence at population level in European blackbirds in 3 city-forest pairs. The observed upward spectral shift in frequency for urban songs relative to forest songs is consistent with previous studies on the same and several other species. A reciprocal playback experiment showed that male blackbirds pay attention to the origin of the stimulus and the divergent spectral trait independently of each other, as well as to a combination of both. The fact that urban and forest males responded differentially to the same spectral song features suggests that the song divergence could influence where males with typical urban or forest songs settle and are able to maintain a territory. Our findings show that habitat-dependent song divergence has the potential to affect the responsiveness to signals in the initial stages of population differentiation.},

In most cases, there has been some suggestion of which traits might be most responsive ahead of time. Bosse et al. turn this approach on its head by using genomic regions with a signature of selection to identify traits that are changing. In great tits (Parus major) in the United Kingdom, genomic regions showing selection invariably contained genes associated with bill growth. Indeed, U.K. birds not only have longer bills, but these longer bills are associated with increased fitness. These changes likely reflect an increase in domestic garden bird feeders over the past several decades.Science, this issue p. 365We used extensive data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major) in the United Kingdom and Netherlands to better understand how genetic signatures of selection translate into variation in fitness and phenotypes. We found that genomic regions under differential selection contained candidate genes for bill morphology and used genetic architecture analyses to confirm that these genes, especially the collagen gene COL4A5, explained variation in bill length. COL4A5 variation was associated with reproductive success, which, combined with spatiotemporal patterns of bill length, suggested ongoing selection for longer bills in the United Kingdom. Last, bill length and COL4A5 variation were associated with usage of feeders, suggesting that longer bills may have evolved in the United Kingdom as a response to supplementary feeding.},

abstract = {When Manduca sexta attacks Nicotiana attenuata, fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs) in the larvae's oral secretions (OS) are introduced into feeding wounds. These FACs trigger a transcriptional response that is similar to the response induced by insect damage. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we characterized the proteins in phenolic extracts and in a nuclear fraction of leaves elicited by larval attack, and/or in leaves wounded and treated with OS, FAC-free OS, and synthetic FACs. Phenolic extracts yielded approximately 600 protein spots, many of which were altered by elicitation, whereas nuclear protein fractions yielded approximately 100 spots, most of which were unchanged by elicitation. Reproducible elicitor-induced changes in 90 spots were characterized. In general, proteins that increased were involved in primary metabolism, defense, and transcriptional and translational regulation; those that decreased were involved in photosynthesis. Like the transcriptional defense responses, proteomic changes were strongly elicited by the FACs in OS. A semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR approach based on peptide sequences was used to compare transcript and protein accumulation patterns for 17 candidate proteins. In six cases the patterns of elicited transcript accumulation were consistent with those of elicited protein accumulation. Functional analysis of one of the identified proteins involved in photosynthesis, RuBPCase activase, was accomplished by virus-induced gene silencing. Plants with decreased levels of RuBPCase activase protein had reduced photosynthetic rates and RuBPCase activity, and less biomass, responses consistent with those of herbivore-attacked plants. We conclude that the response of the plant's proteome to herbivore elicitation is complex, and integrated transcriptome-proteome-metabolome analysis is required to fully understand this ubiquitous ecological interaction.},

abstract = {Understanding how plant recovery from herbivory interacts with the resource environment is necessary to predict under what resource conditions plants are most affected by herbivory, and ultimately how herbivory impacts plant population dynamics. It has been commonly assumed that plants are generally best able to recover from herbivory when growing in high resource conditions, an assumption which is supported by some models (e.g., the continuum of responses model) but opposed by others (e.g., the growth rate model). The validity and generality of any effects of resources (light, nutrients, and water) on plant recovery from herbivory were tested with mixed-model, factorial meta-analyses using a log response ratio metric applied to plant growth and reproduction data from the ecological literature. In total, 81 records from 45 studies were included in the growth meta-analysis, and 24 records from 14 studies in the reproduction meta-analysis. High resource levels and the absence of herbivory both strongly increased plant growth and reproduction. There was no significant overall interaction between growth or reproduction after herbivory and resource conditions, but the interaction terms were significant for each plant functional group in the growth meta-analysis. Basal meristem monocots grew significantly more after herbivory in high resources, while both dicot herbs and woody plants grew significantly more after herbivory in low resources. A similar result was found in the 34.6{\%} of growth records where exact- or overcompensation occurred. Overcompensation was more likely in high resources for monocots and in low resources for dicot herbs. The reproduction data set was too small to subdivide. These qualitative differences between monocot and dicot herbs and woody plants explain many of the contradictory results in the literature and show that no single current model can account for the responses of all plants to herbivory.},

abstract = {The Dobzhansky–Muller (D–M) model of reproductive isolation (RI) posits that hybrid sterility and inviability result from negative epistatic interactions between alleles at a minimum of two genes. This standard model makes several implicit assumptions, including a lack of environmental effects and genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI) involving hybrid sterility and hybrid inviability loci. Here we relax this assumption of the standard D–M model. By doing so, several patterns of the genetic architecture of RI change. First, a novel single-locus model of postzygotic RI emerges. Several indirect lines of evidence are discussed in support of the model, but we conclude that this new single-locus model is currently no more supported than previous ones. Second, when multilocus D–M models incorporating GEI are considered, we find that the number of potential negative epistatic interactions increases dramatically over the number predicted by the standard D–M model, even when only the most simple case of two-allele interactions are considered. Third, these multilocus models suggest that some previous generalizations about the evolutionary genetics of postzygotic RI may not necessarily hold. Our findings also suggest that the evolution of postzygotic RI may be more likely when the expression of traits driving speciation is affected by the environment, since there appears to be a greater spectrum of potential hybrid incompatibilities under the D–M model incorporating GEI.},

In some circumstances (large populations or strong selection, or both) mutational order can be greatly more important than random drift in bringing about divergence. It can generate a `disconnection' between evolution at the phenotypic and genotypic levels, and can give rise to a rough `molecular clock', albeit episodic, that is driven by selection. In the absence of selection, mutational order has little or no effect.},

abstract = {The premise that Pleistocene ice ages played an important role in generating present–day species diversity has been challenged by genetic data indicating that most of the youngest terrestrial species on Earth coalesced long before major glacial advances. However, study has been biased towards faunas distributed at low latitudes that were not directly fragmented by advancing ice sheets. Using mitochondrial sequence divergence and a molecular clock, we compared the coalescence times of pairs of avian species belonging to superspecies complexes from the high–latitude boreal forest with those of sub–boreal and tropical avifaunas of the New World. Remarkably, all coalescence events in boreal superspecies date to the Pleistocene, providing direct evidence that speciation was commonly initiated during recent glacial periods. A pattern of endemism in boreal superspecies plausibly links the timing of divergence to the fragmentation of the boreal forest by ice sheets during the Mid– and Late Pleistocene. In contrast to the boreal superspecies, only 56{\%} of sub–boreal and 46{\%} of tropical superspecies members coalesced during the Pleistocene, suggesting that avifaunas directly fragmented by ice sheets experienced rapid rates of diversification, whereas those distributed farther south were affected to a lesser extent. One explanation for the absence of {\{}pre–Pleistocene{\}} superspecies in boreal avifaunas is that strong selection pressures operated in boreal refugia, causing superspecies members to achieve ecological differentiation at an accelerated rate.},

Equilibrium formulas for large, randomly mating populations demonstrate that, when selection on polygenic variation is much smaller than twice the harmonic mean recombination rate between loci with interacting fitnesses, linkage disequilibrium is negligible and pleiotropy is the main cause of genetic correlations between characters. Under these conditions, approximate expressions for the dynamics of the genetic covariances due to pleiotropic mutations are obtained. Patterns of genetic covariance between characters and their evolution are discussed with reference to data on polygenic mutation, chromosomal organization and morphological integration.},

Field measurements indicated that xylem sap in L. tridentata froze at temperatures below c. -5 degrees C, and that this caused no measurable cavitation for minimum temperatures above -7 degrees C. During the same period P. velutina cavitated almost completely. In the laboratory, we cooled stems of L. tridentata to temperatures ranging from -5 to -20 degrees C, held them at temperature for 1 or 12 h, thawed the stems at a constant rate and measured cavitation by the decrease in hydraulic conductivity of stem segments. As observed in the field, freezing exotherms occurred at temperatures between -6.5 and -9 degrees C and as long as temperatures were held above -11 degrees C there was no change in hydraulic conductivity after thawing. However, when stems were cooled to between -11 degrees C and -20 degrees C, stem hydraulic conductivity de creased linearly with minimum temperature. Minimum temperatures between -16 and -20 degrees C were sufficient to completely eliminate hydraulic conductance. Record ({\textgreater}20 year) minimum isotherms in this same range of temperatures corresponded closely with the northern limit of L. tridentata in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts.},

abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary responses of birds to urbanization has lagged behind understanding ecological responses. Therefore, I provide a conceptual framework for understanding evolutionary processes in urban environments and distill key features of birds that enable them to evolve with the novel features of urban environments. I start by reviewing the growing field of contemporary evolution, or current micro-evolution, that occurs in less than a few hundred years. I then broaden the genetic focus of contemporary evolution by also considering the evolution of cultural traits. This effort builds on the extensive European research on syn-urbization, or the adjustment of animals to urban environments. Contemporary evolution of cultural and genetic traits is well documented in urban environments. Changes in predation, industrial pollution, food sources, noise, and climate have caused the rapid evolution of bird life histories, coloration, morphology, migratory behavior, singing, and foraging behavior. The wide range of genetically and culturally heritable traits suggests that many other changes have evolved in response to urbanization. The uniqueness of the urban environment and the size and isolation of urban bird populations affects genotypic and phenotypic variability and the interactions between genotypes and phenotypes. Responses to selection (or random changes in phenotypes) that are inherited or learned socially define what evolves in urban bird populations, but but population size is also important because stochastic events may extinguish small populations before they adapt to the novel urban environment. Because of the close association between people and birds in urban environments, coevolutionary relationships are possible. Coevolution may involve genetic and cultural traits. For example, humans and corvids appear to be culturally coevolving in American, European, and Asian cities. A variety of characteristics enable contemporary evolution by urban birds: large population size, sociality and innovation, exploitation of people, phenotypic plasticity, high annual reproductive rate, short generation time, environmental uniqueness, and population isolation. Studying contemporary evolution in urban environments requires correlating changes in heritable genetic and cultural traits with environmental conditions, demonstrating that selection is working on these traits, and making a causal connection between the environment and the species' response. Investigations require careful study and ideally a combination of longitudinal and experimental approaches. But it is possible, and showing the public that evolution occurs in their backyards may provide a unique way to engage citizens in science.},

Personality, however, defined as consistent individual differences in behaviour related to exploration, caution, and neophobia, is a good behavioural candidate character to study natural selection in relation to the urban habitat due to its heritable variation. The aim of this paper was to analyse variation in personality by comparing urban and forest great tits Parus major using standard tests of exploratory behaviour and boldness. We studied personality in 130 wild great tits captured in Barcelona city and nearby forests and found that urban birds were more explorative and bolder towards a novel object than forest birds. Genotype frequencies of the DRD4 SNP830 polymorphism, a gene region often associated with personality variation, varied significantly between forest and urban birds. Behavioural scores, however, were not correlated with this polymorphism in our population. Exploration scores correlated to boldness for forest birds but not for urban birds. Our findings suggest that the novel selection pressures of the urban environment favour the decoupling of behavioural traits that commonly form behavioural syndromes in the wild.},

abstract = {Plant species exhibiting polymorphisms with respect to flower color are widespread. Our understanding of the selection pressures that may maintain these color polymorphisms has primarily been confined to one set of organisms-pollinators. Yet, selection on flower color may also be driven by other agents, such as herbivores, especially in cases where pollinators and herbivores are using the same or correlated traits to select plants. A wealth of studies have documented pollinator preference for anthocyanin-recessive color morphs (A-; yellow and white flowers) of wild radish, Raphanus sativus, over anthocyanin-dominant morphs (A+; pink and bronze flowers); yet, differences in pollination alone do not explain the maintenance of the flower color polymorphism. Here, we ask whether variation in flower color in R. sativus influences the preference and performance of herbivores for A- flower color morphs vs. A+ flower color morphs in four types of herbivores (generalist and specialist Lepidoptera, slugs, aphids, and thrips). We found that all herbivores except for aphids and thrips preferred flowering A- color morphs compared to A+ morphs of R. sativus. Furthermore, all herbivores except larvae of specialist and generalist Lepidoptera performed better on A- color morphs. Differences in plant secondary chemistry may play a role in differential herbivore preference and performance on the anthocyanin flower color morphs. Chemical analyses of leaf secondary compounds (indole glucosinolates) revealed that A+ color morphs produced higher concentrations of indole glucosinolates than A- morphs in the presence of herbivore damage. Therefore, herbivores may exhibit lower preference for A+ color morphs, and these morphs may support lower herbivore performance because they are heavily defended once damaged. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to document differential preference and performance of herbivores for different flower color morphs. Previous studies have shown that increased herbivore damage can have profound negative direct and indirect effects on the reproduction of R. sativus. The data presented here suggest that differential preference and performance of herbivores for R. sativus color morphs may counter selection on flower color exerted by pollinators.},

The conservation community has invested decades of resources and hard work to reduce or eliminate these threats. However, it struggles to demonstrate that its efforts are having an impact. In recent years, conservation project managers, teams, and organizations have found themselves under increasing pressure to demonstrate measurable impacts that can be attributed to their actions. To do so, they need to answer three important questions: (1) Are we achieving our desired impact?; (2) Have we selected the best interventions to achieve our desired impact?; and (3) Are we executing our interventions in the best possible manner? We describe results chains, an important tool for helping teams clearly specify their theory of change behind the actions they are implementing. Results chains help teams make their assumptions behind an action explicit and positions the team to develop relevant objectives and indicators to monitor and evaluate whether their actions are having the intended impact. We describe this tool and how it is designed to tackle the three main questions above. We also discuss the purposes for which results chains have been used and the implications of their use. By using results chains, the conservation community can learn, adapt, and improve at a faster pace and, consequently, better address the ongoing threats to species, habitats, and ecosystems.},

This article presents a new diagnostic test to assess students' understanding of natural selection. The test items are based on actual scientific studies of natural selection, whereas previous tests have employed hypothetical situations that were often misleading or oversimplified. The Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection (CINS) is a 20-item multiple choice test that employs common alternative conceptions as distractors. An original 12-item version of the test was field-tested with 170 nonmajors in 6 classes and 43 biology majors in 1 class at 3 community colleges. The test scores of one subset of nonmajors (n¼7) were compared with the students' performances in semistructured interviews. There was a positive correlation between the test scores and the interview scores. The current 20-item version of the CINS was field-tested with 206 students in a nonmajors' general biology course. The face validity, internal validity, reliability, and readability of the CINS are discussed. Results indicate that the CINS will be a valuable tool for instructors.  2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We experimentally explored the potential role of hybridization in facilitating the onset of adaptive radiation. We generated first- and second-generation hybrids of four species of African cichlid fish, extant relatives of the putative ancestors of the adaptive radiations of Lakes Victoria and Malawi. We compared patterns in hybrid morphological variation with the variation in the lake radiations. We show that significant fractions of the interspecific morphological variation and the major trajectories in morphospace that characterize whole radiations can be generated in second-generation hybrids. Furthermore, we show that covariation between traits is relaxed in second-generation hybrids, which may facilitate adaptive diversification. These results support the idea that hybridization can provide the heritable phenotypic diversity necessary to initiate adaptive radiation.},

We compared the climate niche properties and ENM predictions of invasion risk by P. glomerata in North America among models based on (i) all available occurrence records and (ii) records that are taxonomically “reliable”. “Total” records yielded niche properties that were significantly more heterogeneous than reliable records, and consequently, the potential invasion range of P. glomerata based on total records was predicted to be substantially larger.

abstract = {The responses of neurons in sensory cortices are affected by the spatial context within which stimuli are embedded. In the primary visual cortex (V1), orientation-selective responses to stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed by similarly oriented stimuli in the RF surround. Surround suppression, a likely neural correlate of perceptual figure-ground segregation, is traditionally thought to be generated within V1 by long-range horizontal connections. Recently however, it has been shown that these connections are too short and too slow to mediate fast suppression from distant regions of the RF surround. We use an anatomically and physiologically constrained recurrent network model of macaque V1 to show how interareal feedback connections, which are faster and longer-range than horizontal connections, can generate "far" surround suppression. We provide a novel solution to the puzzle of how surround suppression can arise from excitatory feedback axons contacting predominantly excitatory neurons in V1. The basic mechanism involves divergent feedback connections from the far surround targeting pyramidal neurons sending monosynaptic horizontal connections to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the RF center. One of several predictions of our model is that the "suppressive far surround" is not always suppressive, but can facilitate the response of the RF center, depending on the amount of excitatory drive to the local inhibitors. Our model provides a general mechanism of how top-down feedback signals directly contribute to generating cortical neuron responses to simple sensory stimuli.},

abstract = {Herbivory induces various responses in plants, thus altering the plants' phenotype in chemical and morphological traits. Herbivore-induced changes in vegetative plant parts, plant-physiological mechanisms, and effects on plant-animal interactions have been intensively studied from species to community level. In contrast, we are just beginning to examine herbivore-induced effects on reproductive plant parts and flower-visitor interactions, especially in a community context. We investigated the effect of herbivory at different plant developmental stages on plant growth, floral and vegetative phenotype and reproduction in Sinapis arvensis (Brassicaceae). Additionally, we tested how herbivore-induced plant responses affect flower-visitor interactions and plant reproduction in species-rich communities. Our results indicate that the timing of herbivory affects the magnitude of changes in plant traits. Herbivory in early but not in late development accelerated the plant's flowering phenology, reduced vegetative growth, increased stem trichome density and altered floral morphology and scent. These findings suggest age-dependent trade-offs between growth, defense and reproduction. Herbivore-induced changes in flower traits also affected flower-visitor interactions in a community context with effects on the structure of flower-visitor networks. However, changes in the network structure had neglectable effects on plant reproduction, i.e. plants were able to compensate altered flower visitor behavior. Thus, herbivory is a source of intraspecific variation in reproductive traits, which can be behaviorally relevant for potential pollinators. However, plants were capable to maintain reproductive success suggesting a tolerance against herbivory. We conclude that in our study system induced direct or indirect defenses that have often been shown to decrease negative effects of herbivores on vegetative plant parts come at no costs for plant reproduction.

abstract = {Although plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator interactions have traditionally been studied separately, many traits are simultaneously under selection by both herbivores and pollinators. For example, secondary compounds commonly associated with herbivore defense have been found in the nectar of many plant species, and many plants produce nectar that is toxic or repellent to some floral visitors. Although secondary compounds in nectar and toxic nectar are geographically and phylogenetically widespread, their ecological significance is poorly understood. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the possible functions of toxic nectar, including encouraging specialist pollinators, deterring nectar robbers, preventing microbial degradation of nectar, and altering pollinator behavior. All of these hypotheses rest on the assumption that the benefits of toxic nectar must outweigh possible costs; however, to date no study has demonstrated that toxic nectar provides fitness benefits for any plant. Therefore, in addition to these adaptive hypotheses, we should also consider the hypothesis that toxic nectar provides no benefits or is tolerably detrimental to plants, and occurs due to previous selection pressures or pleiotropic constraints. For example, secondary compounds may be transported into nectar as a consequence of their presence in phloem, rather than due to direct selection for toxic nectar. Experimental approaches are necessary to understand the role of toxic nectar in plant-animal interactions.},

abstract = {Two models for speciation via selection have been proposed. In the well-known model of 'ecological speciation', divergent natural selection between environments drives the evolution of reproductive isolation. In a second 'mutation-order' model, different, incompatible mutations (alleles) fix in different populations adapting to the same selective pressure. How to demonstrate mutation-order speciation has been unclear, although it has been argued that it can be ruled out when gene flow occurs because the same, most advantageous allele will fix in all populations. However, quantitative examination of the interaction of factors influencing the likelihood of mutation-order speciation is lacking. We used simulation models to study how gene flow, hybrid incompatibility, selective advantage, timing of origination of new mutations and an initial period of allopatric differentiation affect population divergence via the mutation-order process. We find that at least some population divergence can occur under a reasonably wide range of conditions, even with moderate gene flow. However, strong divergence (e. g. fixation of different alleles in different populations) requires very low gene flow, and is promoted when (i) incompatible mutations have similar fitness advantages, (ii) less fit mutations arise slightly earlier in evolutionary time than more fit alternatives, and (iii) allopatric divergence occurs prior to secondary contact.},

abstract = {Self-pollination is common in plants, and limited seed and pollen dispersal can create localized inbreeding even within outcrossing plants. Consequently, insects regularly encounter inbred plants in nature. Because inbreeding results in elevated homozygosity, greater expression of recessive alleles, and subsequent phenotypic changes in inbred plants, inbreeding may alter plant-insect interactions. Recent research has found that plant inbreeding alters resistance and tolerance to herbivores, alters the attraction and susceptibility of plants to insects that vector plant pathogens, and alters visitation rates of insect pollinators. These results suggest that interactions with insects can increase or decrease inbreeding depression (the loss of fitness due to self-fertilization) and subsequently alter the evolution of selfing within plant populations. Future work needs to focus on the mechanisms underlying genetic variation in the effects of inbreeding on plant-insect interactions and the consequences of altered plant-insect interactions on the evolution of plant defense and plant mating systems.},

Maternal inheritance results in time lags in the evolutionary response to selection. These cause a population to evolve for an indefinite number of generations after selection ceases and make the rate and direction of evolution change even when the strength of selection and parameters of inheritance remain constant. The rate and direction of evolution depend on the inheritance of traits that are not under selection, unlike under classical Mendelian inheritance. The models confirm earlier findings that the response to selection can be larger or smaller than what is possible with simple Mendelian inheritance, and even in a direction opposite to what selection favors. Maternal selection, in which a mother's phenotype influences her offspring's fitness, is frequency-dependent and can cause a population to evolve maladaptively away from a fitness peak, regardless of whether traits are transmitted by Mendelian or maternal inheritance. Maternal selection differs from other forms of selection in that its force depends not only on the fitness function but also on the phenotypic resemblance of parents and offspri},

abstract = {Homoploid hybrid speciation is the origin of a hybrid species without change in chromosome number. Although currently thought to be a rare form of speciation, especially relative to the more common allopolyploid hybrid speciation, it is feasible that many examples of homoploid hybrid species will be discovered in the future now that genetic resources are readily available for testing their occurrence. In this review, we focus on the speed of homoploid hybrid speciation, the importance of ecological and spatial isolation in the process, and the nature of genetic changes that occur in a new hybrid during its origin and establishment in the wild. With reference mainly to the extensive work carried out on homoploid hybrid species of Helianthus, and to our own work on the very recently originated diploid hybrid species Senecio squalidus, we review evidence showing: (1) that new fertile homoploid hybrid species can originate very quickly, although a longer period is likely to be required before the species becomes fully stabilized both genomically and phenotypically; (2) ecological divergence of the hybrid species from its parents is key to successful establishment, and that this can occur even in the absence of post-zygotic isolation caused by chromosomal and/or genetic sterility barriers; (3) transgressive changes in phenotypic traits and gene expression are of great importance in adapting homoploid hybrid species to habitats that are ecologically and spatially divergent from those of the parents; (4) adaptive differences distinguishing a homoploid hybrid species from its parental species are likely to be maintained in the face of parental gene flow, and evolve in concert across populations representing multiple origins of the species; (5) in the absence of parental gene flow, i.e., under conditions of geographical isolation, rapid genetic divergence of the hybrid species is likely to be enhanced due to the combined effects of founder events, genetic drift and selection.

This resurgence highlights a major deficiency in our understanding of allelopathy-the lack of a well-developed ecological context for the interaction. In contrast to allelopathy, the plant-plant interaction of competition has a strong theoretical foundation as well as a large body of supporting empirical studies. We suggest that the plant-herbivore defense literature provides a mature and well-developed framework from which a broader ecological context for allelopathy can be developed. Here, we discuss three broad classes of questions, drawn from the herbivore defense literature, which may help to develop an appropriate ecological context for allelopathy. These questions focus on (1) variation in allelopathic expression within species, (2) community level variation in allelopathy across species, and (3) variation in the impacts of allelopathy on associated species. Addressing such broad population and community level themes in a variety of systems will be necessary to fully develop an ecological context for allelopathy and provide a theoretical basis for understanding its role in plant communities.},

abstract = {How increasing urbanization affects biodiversity is one of the most understudied aspects of global change biology. It is, however, known that it may negatively affect plant population genetic diversity in numerous ways, for example through its negative effects on plant population size, between-population connectivity, and reproductive success. Therefore, it is important to investigate to what extent different levels of urbanization result in these negative phenomena. Here we used microsatellite markers to investigate urbanization effects on the population genetic structure of 23 populations of the self-incompatible, partially clonal herb Linaria vulgaris which were sampled across a gradient of urbanization. Clonal diversity as measured by the Pareto-parameter varied between 1.11 and 2.97 and was negatively correlated to both the degree of urbanization and to population size. Urbanization and population size were not interrelated. The least clonally rich populations also experienced significantly reduced seed set. Irrespective of the degree of urbanization, L. vulgaris populations exhibited strong genetic differentiation (FST = 0.33) and there was no significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances, suggesting low gene flow among populations. In conclusion, we showed that urbanization negatively affected fitness of L. vulgaris populations through decreasing their clonal diversity and reproductive success, an effect that may be exacerbated by the low gene flow between populations. Although the effect was modest, the results could probably be extrapolated to bigger cities where it would be considerably more pronounced.},

These fish are found in habitats that are atypical for the known species Cottus gobio, which is confined to small cold streams within the Rhine drainage. Phylogeographic analysis based on mitochondrial haplotypes and diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms indicates that the invasive sculpins are hybrids between two old lineages from the River Scheldt drainage and the River Rhine drainage, although it is morphologically more similar to the Scheldt sculpins. Most importantly, however, the invasive population possesses a unique ecological potential that does not occur in either of the source populations from the Rhine or the Scheldt, which allows the colonization of new habitats that have previously been free of sculpins. Microsatellite analysis shows that the new lineage is genetically intermediate between the old lineages and that it forms a distinct genetic group across its whole expansion range. We conclude that hybridization between long separated groups has lead to the fast emergence of a new, adaptationally distinct sculpin lineage.},

Estimates were taken from the literature for both wild and domestic species and each group was treated separately. Traits closely associated with fitness (life history) had significantly higher dominance components than did traits more distantly related to fitness (morphology) for wild species. No significant differences were found between life history and morphological traits for domestic species. Traits that were known to have been subject to intense directional selection (morphological traits for domestic species) had significantly higher dominance estimates than did traits that were assumed not to have been subject to strong selection (morphological traits for wild outbred species). The results are discussed with respect to the maintenance of heritable variation and the bias introduced in the calculation of the full-sib heritability estimate by high levels of dominance variance.},

abstract = {Hybrids may suffer a reduced fitness both because they fall between ecological niches (ecologically dependent isolation) and as a result of intrinsic genetic incompatibilities between the parental genomes (ecologically independent isolation). Whereas genetic incompatibilities are common to all theories of speciation, ecologically dependent isolation is a unique prediction of the ecological model of speciation. This prediction can be tested using reciprocal transplants in which the fitness of various genotypes is evaluated in both parental habitats. Here we expand a quantitative genetic model of Lynch (1991) to include two parental environments. We ask whether a sufficient experimental design exists for detecting ecologically dependent isolation. Analysis of the model reveals that by using both backcrosses in both parental environments, environment-specific additive genetic effects can be estimated while correcting for any intrinsic genetic isolation. Environment-specific dominance effects can also be estimated by including the F1 and F2 in the reciprocal transplant. In contrast, a reciprocal transplant comparing only F1s or F2s to the parental species cannot separate ecologically dependent from intrinsic genetic isolation. Thus, a reduced fitness of F1 or F2 hybrids relative to the parental species is not sufficient to demonstrate ecological speciation. The model highlights the importance of determining the contribution of genetic and ecological mechanisms to hybrid fitness if inferences concerning speciation mechanisms are to be made.},

abstract = {Niche dimensionality is suggested to be a key determinant of ecological speciation ("multifarious selection" hypothesis), but genetic aspects of this process have not been investigated theoretically. We use Fisher's geometrical model to study how niche dimensionality influences the mean fitness of hybrids formed upon secondary contact between populations adapting in allopatry. Gaussian selection for an optimum generates two forms of reproductive isolation (RI): an extrinsic component due to maladaptation of the mean phenotype, and an intrinsic variance load resulting from what we term transgressive incompatibilities between mutations fixed in different populations. We show that after adaptation to a new environment, RI increases with (1) the mean initial maladaptation of diverging population, and (2) niche dimensionality, which increases the phenotypic variability of fixed mutations. Under mutation selection drift equilibrium in a constant environment, RI accumulates steadily with time, at a rate that also increases with niche dimensionality. A similar pattern can be produced by successive shifts in the optimum phenotype. Niche dimensionality thus has an effect per se on postzygotic isolation, beyond putative indirect effects (stronger selection, more genes). Our mechanism is consistent with empirical evidence about transgressive segregation in crosses between divergent populations, and with patterns of accumulation of RI with time in many taxa.},

Here we report on studies comparing the aphids Aphis nerii and A. asclepiadis that feed sympatrically on the milkweed Asclepias syriaca in northeastern North America. We sought to identify tradeoffs among species' attributes that might promote coexistence, but in most instances A. nerii was superior to A. asclepiadis. Aphis nerii was 84{\%} more fecund, fed upon 880{\%} more phloem sap, and was affected 70{\%} less by intraspecific competition as compared to A. asclepiadis. In interspecific competition, A. nerii reduced A. asclepiadis abundance by 77{\%}, whereas A. asclepiadis did not affect A. nerii. In dispersal trials, 10{\%} of winged A. nerii but only 1{\%} of A. asclepiadis successfully moved from non-host plants to A. syriaca. We also investigated whether there were differences in aphid interactions with milkweed cardenolides. Jasmonic acid increased milkweed cardenolides by 33{\%}, a realistic amount similar to that induced by several leaf-chewing herbivores. Nevertheless, jasmonate-induced cardenolides failed to affect aphid performance and aphid feeding had no effect on milkweed cardenolide concentration. Yet cardenolides were important for aphid resistance to predators; A. nerii sequestered 25{\%} more cardenolides and was preyed upon 50{\%} less than A. asclepiadis. Interactions with cardenolides thus again favored A. nerii over A. asclepiadis. Given that A. nerii and A. asclepiadis are decidedly not equivalent in their demography, competitive ability, defense and dispersal, our results strongly refute the notion that neutral processes can explain coexistence of these aphids. Based on field observations, we propose two tradeoffs - timing of milkweed colonization and relationships with ants - as putative mechanisms for the coexistence of these congeners.},

Urban ecology has advanced our understanding of how the development of cities and towns changes environmental conditions and alters ecological processes and patterns. However, despite decades of research in urban ecology, the extent to which urbanization influences evolutionary and eco-evolutionary change has received little attention. The nascent field of urban evolutionary ecology seeks to understand how urbanization affects the evolution of populations, and how those evolutionary changes in turn influence the ecological dynamics of populations, Accepted Article communities, and ecosystems. Following a brief history of this emerging field, this Perspective article provides a research agenda and roadmap for future research aimed at advancing our understanding of the interplay between ecology and evolution of urban-dwelling organisms. We identify six key questions that, if addressed, would significantly increase our understanding of how urbanization influences evolutionary processes. These questions consider how urbanization affects non-adaptive evolution, natural selection, and convergent evolution, in addition to the role of urban environmental heterogeneity on species evolution, and the roles of phenotypic plasticity vs adaptation on species' abundance in cities. Our final question examines the impact of urbanization on evolutionary diversification. For each of these six questions, we suggest avenues for future research that will help advance the field of urban evolutionary ecology. Lastly, we highlight the importance of integrating urban evolutionary ecology into urban planning, conservation practice, pest management, and public engagement.},

abstract = {Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. is a major invasive weed in many regions of the world, and has significant impact on agricultural ecosystems. This paper studied the allelopathic effects of the burned and unburned A. artemisiifolia residues and their water extracts on wheat growth, aimed to approach whether burning could eliminate or weaken the allelopathic effects of A. artemisiifolia residue. Both the residue and its water extracts had inhibitory effects on the early growth of wheat, but the impact of the residue was smaller than that of the extracts, suggesting that the allelochemicals in A. artemisiifolia residue were water-soluble, and water extraction could release the allelochemicals into soil to a great extent. The addition of the residue also made the soil physical and chemical properties changed. With the increasing amount of added A. artemisiifolia residue, the soil pH, conductivity, organic carbon content, and the contents of phenolic compounds (main components of allelochemicals) all increased to some extent, which in integration inhibited wheat growth. Both the burned and unburned residues inhibited wheat growth significantly, and no significant difference was observed between the residues. Therefore, it was not the good way to burn the A. artemisiifolia residue to eliminate its allelopathic effects on native plants.},

abstract = {The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for {\textgreater}30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that "replayed" evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 10(12) cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.},

abstract = {To investigate the potential for and constraints on the evolution of compensatory ability, we performed a greenhouse experiment using Asclepias syriaca in which foliar damage and soil nutrient concentration were manipulated. Under low nutrient conditions, significant genetic variation was detected for allocation patterns and for compensatory ability. Furthermore, resource allocation to storage was positively, genetically correlated both with compensatory ability and biomass when damaged, the last two being positively, genetically correlated with each other. Thus, in the low nutrient environment, compensatory ability via resource allocation to storage provided greater biomass when damaged. A negative genetic correlation between compensatory ability and plant biomass when undamaged suggests that this mechanism entailed an allocation cost, which would constrain the evolution of greater compensatory ability when nutrients are limited. Under high nutrient conditions, neither compensatory ability nor allocation patterns predicted biomass when damaged, even though genetic variation in compensatory ability existed. Instead, plant biomass when undamaged predicted biomass when damaged. The differences in outcomes between the two nutrient treatments highlight the importance of considering the possible range of environmental conditions that a genotype may experience. Furthermore, traits that conferred compensatory ability did not necessarily contribute to biomass when damaged, demonstrating that it is critical to examine both compensatory ability and biomass when damaged to determine whether selection by herbivores can favor the evolution of increased compensation.},

Bumble bees are one of the most effective native pollinators and are often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats, yet little is known about how bumble bees move across fine spatial scales and what landscapes promote or limit their gene flow. In this study, we examine regional genetic differentiation and fine-scale relatedness patterns of the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, to investigate how current and historic habitat composition impact gene flow. We conducted our study across a landscape mosaic of natural, agricultural and urban/suburban habitats, and we show that B. vosnesenskii exhibits low but significant levels of differentiation across the study system (FST  = 0.019, Dest  = 0.049). Most importantly, we reveal significant relationships between pairwise FST and resistance models created from contemporary land use maps. Specifically, B. vosnesenskii gene flow is most limited by commercial, industrial and transportation-related impervious cover. Finally, our fine-scale analysis reveals significant but declining relatedness between individuals at the 1-9 km spatial scale, most likely due to local queen dispersal. Overall, our results indicate that B. vosnesenskii exhibits considerable local dispersal and that regional gene flow is significantly limited by impervious cover associated with urbanization.},

The rate of stolon elongation was greatest (2.01 cm/week) in late July and a maximum rate of node production (1.48 new nodes/stolon per week) occurred in early Aug. As stolons extended through the pasture they encountered a number of different grass species including Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus, Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense and Poa spp. The stolons grew through a total of 2 m of H. lanatus neighbourhood and produced only 3 branches, whereas they produced 19.3 branches per metre of P. pratense neighbourhood. It was concluded that neighbouring grasses impose different local environments on the nodes and stolons of T. repens and consequently influence the dynamics of node production, the rate of stolon elongation and the amount of stolon branching.},

abstract = {Theoretical models indicate that the evolution of tetraploids in diploid populations will depend on both the relative fitness of the tetraploid and that of the diploid-tetraploid hybrids. Hybrids are believed to have lower fitness due to imbalances in either the ploidy (endosperm imbalance) or the ratio of maternal to paternal genomes in their endosperm (genomic imprinting). In this study we created diploids, tetraploids, and hybrid triploids of Chamerion angustifolium from crosses between field-collected diploid and tetraploid plants and evaluated them at six life stages in a greenhouse comparison. Diploid offspring (from 2x x 2x crosses) had significantly higher seed production and lower biomass than tetraploid offspring (from 4x x 4x crosses). Relative to the diploid, the cumulative fitness of tetraploids was 0.67. In general, triploids (from 2x x 4x, 4x x 2x crosses) had significantly lower seed production, lower pollen viability, and higher biomass than diploid individuals. Triploid offspring derived from diploid maternal parents had lower germination rates, but higher pollen production than those with tetraploid mothers. Relative to diploids, the cumulative fitness of 2x x 4x triploids and 4x x 2x triploids was 0.12 and 0.06, respectively, providing some support for effect of differing maternal:paternal ratios and endosperm development as a mechanism of hybrid inviability. Collectively, the data show that tetraploids exhibit an inherent fitness disadvantage, although the partial viability and fertility of triploids may help to reduce the barrier to tetraploid establishment in sympatric populations.},

FGM describes adaptation as the movement of a genotype toward a fitness optimum due to beneficial mutations. To date, one prediction of FGM, the probability of improvement is related to the distance from the optimum, has only been tested in microorganisms under laboratory conditions. There is reason to believe that results might differ under natural conditions where more mutations likely affect fitness, and where environmental variance may obscure the expected pattern.We chemically induced mutations into a set of 19 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from across the native range of A. thaliana and planted them alongside the premutated founder lines in two habitats in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States under field conditions. We show that FGM is able to predict the outcome of a set of random induced mutations on fitness in a set of A. thaliana accessions grown in the wild: mutations are more likely to be beneficial in relatively less fit genotypes. This finding suggests that FGM is an accurate approximation of the process of adaptation under more realistic ecological conditions.},

abstract = {Variation in cyanogenesis (hydrogen cyanide release following tissue damage) was first noted in populations of white clover more than a century ago, and subsequent decades of research have established this system as a classic example of an adaptive chemical defence polymorphism. Here, we document polymorphisms for cyanogenic components in several relatives of white clover, and we determine the molecular basis of this trans-specific adaptive variation. One hundred and thirty-nine plants, representing 13 of the 14 species within Trifolium section Trifoliastrum, plus additional species across the genus, were assayed for cyanogenic components (cyanogenic glucosides and their hydrolysing enzyme, linamarase) and for the presence of underlying cyanogenesis genes (CYP79D15 and Li, respectively). One or both cyanogenic components were detected in seven species, all within section Trifoliastrum; polymorphisms for the presence/absence (PA) of components were detected in six species. In a pattern that parallels our previous findings for white clover, all observed biochemical polymorphisms correspond to gene PA polymorphisms at CYP79D15 and Li. Relationships of DNA sequence haplotypes at the cyanogenesis loci and flanking genomic regions suggest independent evolution of gene deletions within species. This study thus provides evidence for the parallel evolution of adaptive biochemical polymorphisms through recurrent gene deletions in multiple species.},

The total number of species derived from in situ speciation increases with lake size, resulting in faunas orders of magnitude higher in species richness than faunas assembled by immigration alone. Multivariate models provide evidence for added influence of lake depth on the species-area relationship. Diversity of clades representing within-lake radiations show responses to lake area, depth and energy consistent with limitation by these factors, suggesting that ecological factors influence the species richness of radiating clades within these ecosystems. Together, these processes produce lake fish faunas with highly variable composition, but with diversities that are well predicted by environmental variables.},

In urban environments, anthropogenic noise can interfere with animal communication. Here we study the influence of urban noise on the cultural evolution of bird songs. We studied three adjacent dialects of white-crowned sparrow songs over a 30-year time span. Urban noise, which is louder at low frequencies, increased during our study period and therefore should have created a selection pressure for songs with higher frequencies. We found that the minimum frequency of songs increased both within and between dialects during the 30-year time span. For example, the dialect with the highest minimum frequency is in the process of replacing another dialect that has lower frequency songs. Songs with the highest minimum frequency were favoured in this environment and should have the most effective transmission properties. We suggest that one mechanism that influences how dialects, and cultural traits in general, are selected and transmitted from one generation to the next is the dialect's ability to be effectively communicated in the local environment.},

abstract = {The ability to efficiently and accurately determine genotypes is a keystone technology in modern genetics, crucial to studies ranging from clinical diagnostics, to genotype-phenotype association, to reconstruction of ancestry and the detection of selection. To date, high capacity, low cost genotyping has been largely achieved via "SNP chip" microarray-based platforms which require substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants, a major source of information for both population history and genotype-phenotype association. Recent developments in reduced-representation genome sequencing experiments on massively parallel sequencers (commonly referred to as RAD-tag or RADseq) have brought direct sequencing to the problem of population genotyping, but increased cost and procedural and analytical complexity have limited their widespread adoption. Here, we describe a complete laboratory protocol, including a custom combinatorial indexing method, and accompanying software tools to facilitate genotyping across large numbers (hundreds or more) of individuals for a range of markers (hundreds to hundreds of thousands). Our method requires no prior genomic knowledge and achieves per-site and per-individual costs below that of current SNP chip technology, while requiring similar hands-on time investment, comparable amounts of input DNA, and downstream analysis times on the order of hours. Finally, we provide empirical results from the application of this method to both genotyping in a laboratory cross and in wild populations. Because of its flexibility, this modified RADseq approach promises to be applicable to a diversity of biological questions in a wide range of organisms.},

Many studies from the 1980s and 1990s often asked questions about whether certain processes ever occur in nature (e.g., speciation with gene flow). Since that time, case studies have provided evidence that nearly all evolutionary processes thought to be involved in speciation have occurred at least once. As a result, we are now in a new era where the “big questions” must go beyond demonstrations that a phenomenon has happened at least once. Here we discuss a few open questions in speciation—questions that we feel are not only exciting but tractable. We focus our discussion most sharply on recent studies in Drosophila and related species, the area of our expertise.

Much of this interest has involved the potential for codiversification, both in how the interaction itself diversifies and how the interaction affects modes and rates of speciation. Despite high levels of conservatism and specialization, diversification of the interaction appears to be mainly a consequence of host shifts, but this somewhat paradoxical conclusion can be understood by an appreciation of the ecological as well as genetic mechanisms behind host shifts. There are several ways that the interaction can influence speciation, with or without host-plant-based divergent selection on reproductive barriers. One current debate is over the relative importance of radiations following shifts to new adaptive zones and elevated rates of speciation in groups with plastic and diverse host use.},

Fitness, measured as the finite rate of increase ({\^{I}}»), depended strongly on environment. Each parental species performed well in its home locale and poorly in the locale of the other species.

abstract = {Urban areas are increasing globally, providing opportunities for biodiversity researchers to study the process in which species become established in novel, highly disturbed habitats. This ecological process can be understood through analyses of morphological and genetic variation, which can shed light on patterns of neutral and adaptive evolution. Previous studies have shown that urban populations often diverge genetically from non-urban source populations. This could occur due to neutral genetic drift, but an alternative is that selection could lead to allele frequency changes in urban populations. The development of genome scan methods provides an opportunity to investigate these outcomes from samples of genetic variation taken along an urbanization gradient. Here we examine morphological variation in wing size and diversity at neutral amplified fragment length polymorphisms in the butterfly Pieris rapae L. (Lepidoptera, Pieridae) sampled from the center to the periphery of Marseille. We utilize established and novel environmental correlation approaches to scan genetic variation for evidence of selection. We find significant morphological differences in urban populations, as well as weak genetic structure and decreased genetic diversity in urban versus non-urban sites. However, environmental correlation tests provide little support for selection in our dataset. Our comparison of different methods and allele frequency clines suggests that loci identified as significant are false positives. Although there is some indication that selection may be acting on wing size in urban butterflies, genetic analyses suggest P. rapae are undergoing neutral drift.},

have appeared inside and outside of a unique sea basin, the Sea of
Japan, providing a valuable opportunity to explore marine phenotypic
evolution and speciation in relation to Pleistocene glacial isolation.
We examined divergence in body size-related and behavioural traits,
which may be important drivers of reproductive isolation, between the
allopatric Japan Sea (JS) and Pacific Ocean (PO) lineages of the ice

the JS lineage had rapid growth rates, and consequently evolved towards
a larger size. Divergence in female mate choice patterns was also
detected by within-and between-lineage mate choice experiments. The JS
females demonstrated preferences for larger and same-lineage males,
whereas the PO females did not. However, our genetic analysis of a
contact zone population showed that such phenotypic divergence did not
appear to contribute to reproductive isolation. Thus, the present study
clarified the evolution of endemic phenotypes in this unique sea basin,
together with the position of the diverging pair on the speciation

abstract = {Research in molecular ecology is now often based on large numbers of DNA sequence reads. Given a time and financial budget for DNA sequencing, the question arises as to how to allocate the finite number of sequence reads among three dimensions: (i) sequencing individual nucleotide positions repeatedly and achieving high confidence in the true genotype of individuals, (ii) sampling larger numbers of individuals from a population, and (iii) sampling a larger fraction of the genome. Leaving aside the question of what fraction of the genome to sample, we analyze the trade-off between repeatedly sequencing the same nucleotide position (coverage depth) and the number of individuals in the sample. We review simple Bayesian models for allele frequencies and utilize these in the analysis of how to obtain maximal information about population genetic parameters. The models indicate that sampling larger numbers of individuals, at the expense of coverage depth per nucleotide position, provides more information about population parameters. Dividing the sequencing effort maximally among individuals and obtaining approximately one read per locus and individual (1 × coverage) yields the most information about a population. Some analyses require genetic parameters for individuals, in which case Bayesian population models also support inference from lower coverage sequence data than are required for simple likelihood models. Low coverage sequencing is not only sufficient to support inference, but it is optimal to design studies to utilize low coverage because they will yield highly accurate and precise parameter estimates based on more individuals or sites in the genome.},

abstract = {Divergent natural selection contributes to reproductive isolation among populations adapting to different habitats or resources if hybrids between populations are intermediate in phenotype and suffer an associated, environmentally dependent reduction in fitness. This prediction was tested using two host races of Mitoura butterflies. Thirty-five F1 hybrid and parental lines were created, larvae were raised on the two host plants, and oviposition preferences were assayed in choice arenas. Larvae from both reciprocal hybrid crosses suffered a host-specific reduction in performance: when reared on incense cedar, hybrid survival was approximately 30{\%} less than the survival of pure lines of the cedar-associated host race. The performance of hybrid larvae reared on the other host, MacNab cypress, was not reduced relative to parental genotypes. Females from both reciprocal hybrid crosses preferred to oviposit on incense cedar, the same host that resulted in the reduced survival of hybrid larvae. Thus, dominance is implicated in the inheritance of traits involved in both preference and performance, which do not appear to be genetically linked in Mitoura butterflies. Gene flow between host races may be reduced because the correlation between preference and performance that was previously described in parental populations is essentially broken by hybridization.},

The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two characters. The method takes into account information on the lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an application to the Hominoidea.},

abstract = {We analyze the changes in the mean and variance components of a quantitative trait caused by changes in allele frequencies, concentrating on the effects of genetic drift. We use a general representation of epistasis and dominance that allows an arbitrary relation between genotype and phenotype for any number of diallelic loci. We assume initial and final Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium in our analyses of drift-induced changes. Random drift generates transient linkage disequilibria that cause correlations between allele frequency fluctuations at different loci. However, we show that these have negligible effects, at least for interactions among small numbers of loci. Our analyses are based on diffusion approximations that summarize the effects of drift in terms of F, the inbreeding coefficient, interpreted as the expected proportional decrease in heterozygosity at each locus. For haploids, the variance of the trait mean after a population bottleneck is var(Delta(z) over bar) = Sigma(k)(=1)(n) (FVA(k))-V-k, where n is the number of loci contributing to the trait variance, V-A(1) = V-A is the additive genetic variance, and V-A(k) is the kth-order additive epistatic variance. The expected additive genetic variance after the bottleneck, denoted {\textless}V-A(*){\textgreater} is closely related to var(Delta(z) over bar); {\textless}V-A(*){\textgreater} = (1 - F) Sigma(k)(=1)(n) kF(k-1) V-A(k). Thus, epistasis inflates the expected additive variance above V-A(1 - F), the expectation under additivity. For haploids (and diploids without dominance), the expected value of every variance component is inflated by the existence of higher order interactions (e.g., third-order epistasis inflates {\textless}V-AA(*){\textgreater}). This is not true in general with diploidy, because dominance alone can reduce {\textless}VA(*){\textgreater} below V-A(1 - F) (e.g., when dominant alleles are rare). Without A dominance, diploidy produces simple expressions: var(Delta(z) over bar) = Sigma(k)(=1)(n) (2F)(k) V-k(A(k)) and {\textless}V-A(*){\textgreater} = (1 - F) Sigma(k)(=1)(n) k(2F)V-k-1(A(k).) k With dominance (and even without epistasis), var(Delta(z) over bar) and no longer depend solely on the variance components in the base population. For small F, the expected additive variance simplifies to {\textless}V-A(*){\textgreater} similar or equal to (1 - F)V-A +4FV(AA) + 2FV(D) + 2FC(AD), where C-AD is a sum of two terms describing covariances between additive effects and dominance and additive X dominance interactions. Whether population bottlenecks lead to expected increases in additive variance depends primarily on the ratio of nonadditive to additive genetic variance in the base population, but dominance precludes simple predictions based solely on variance components. We illustrate these results using a model in which genotypic values are drawn at random, allowing extreme and erratic epistatic interactions. Although our analyses clarify the conditions under which drift is expected to increase V-A, we question the evolutionary importance of such increases.},

Only S. atromaculatus x N. biguttatus hybrids had a greater number of characters that were intermediate than were not. Divergence from intermediacy is not related to phylogenetic relation- ship among the crosses analyzed. The S. atromaculatus x C. anomalum experi- mental hybrids from Ohio populations differed in several respects from speci- mens analyzed by Cross and Minckley (1960) from Kansas and Nebraska. The number of lateral line scales and the ratio interorbital width/standard length were significantly different between two series of hybrids produced by crossing a male S. atromaculatus with two female C. anomalum from the same watershed. In both cases the index value of one series was intermediate but the value for the other series was not. These data support caution in assuming that phenotypic expression in hybrids is consistently intermediate, or that character expression is consistent among hybrids of the same cross. Certain trends in character expression existed among the four hybrid crosses analyzed. Knowledge of such trends may be useful in identification of unknown hybrid forms.},

The group admits that the two-locus barcode is far from perfect due to the low identification rate, and the search is not over. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we compared seven candidate DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, matK, rbcL, rpoC1, ycf5, ITS2, and ITS) from medicinal plant species. Our ranking criteria included PCR amplification efficiency, differential intra- and inter-specific divergences, and the DNA barcoding gap. Our data suggest that the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA represents the most suitable region for DNA barcoding applications. Furthermore, we tested the discrimination ability of ITS2 in more than 6600 plant samples belonging to 4800 species from 753 distinct genera and found that the rate of successful identification with the ITS2 was 92.7{\%} at the species level. CONCLUSIONS: The ITS2 region can be potentially used as a standard DNA barcode to identify medicinal plants and their closely related species. We also propose that ITS2 can serve as a novel universal barcode for the identification of a broader range of plant taxa.},

abstract = {Summary: Plant traits that enhance the attraction of the natural enemies of their herbivores have been postulated to function as an 'indirect defence'. An important underlying assumption is that this enhanced attraction results in increased plant fitness due to reduced herbivory. This assumption has been rarely tested. We investigated whether there are fitness consequences for the charlock mustard Sinapis arvensis, a short-lived outcrossing annual weedy plant, when exposed to groups of large cabbage white (Pieris brassicae) caterpillars parasitized by either one of two wasp species, Hyposoter ebeninus and Cotesia glomerata, that allow the host to grow during parasitism. Hyposoter ebeninus is solitary and greatly reduces host growth compared with healthy caterpillars, whereas C. glomerata is gregarious and allows the host to grow approximately as large as unparasitized caterpillars. Both healthy and parasitized P. brassicae caterpillars initially feed on the foliage, but later stages preferentially consume the flowers. In a garden experiment, plants damaged by parasitized caterpillars produced more seeds than conspecific plants damaged by unparasitized caterpillars. Reproductive potential (germination success multiplied by total seed number) was similar for plants that were not exposed to herbivory and those that were damaged by parasitized caterpillars and lower for plants that were damaged by healthy unparasitized caterpillars. However, these quantitative seed traits negatively correlated with the qualitative seed traits, individual seed size and germination success, suggesting a trade-off between these two types of traits. We show that parasitism of insect herbivores that feed on reproductive plant tissues may have positive fitness consequences for S. arvensis. The extent to which plant fitness may benefit depends on parasitoid lifestyle (solitary or gregarious), which is correlated with the amount of damage inflicted on these tissues by the parasitized host.},

abstract = {Cyanogenesis, the release of hydrogen cyanide from damaged plant tissues, involves the enzymatic degradation of amino acid-derived cyanogenic glucosides (alpha-hydroxynitrile glucosides) by specific beta-glucosidases. Release of cyanide functions as a defense mechanism against generalist herbivores. We developed a high-throughput screening method and used it to identify cyanogenesis deficient (cyd) mutants in the model legume Lotus japonicus. Mutants in both biosynthesis and catabolism of cyanogenic glucosides were isolated and classified following metabolic profiling of cyanogenic glucoside content. L. japonicus produces two cyanogenic glucosides: linamarin (derived from Val) and lotaustralin (derived from Ile). Their biosynthesis may involve the same set of enzymes for both amino acid precursors. However, in one class of mutants, accumulation of lotaustralin and linamarin was uncoupled. Catabolic mutants could be placed in two complementation groups, one of which, cyd2, encoded the beta-glucosidase BGD2. Despite the identification of nine independent cyd2 alleles, no mutants involving the gene encoding a closely related beta-glucosidase, BGD4, were identified. This indicated that BGD4 plays no role in cyanogenesis in L. japonicus in vivo. Biochemical analysis confirmed that BGD4 cannot hydrolyze linamarin or lotaustralin and in L. japonicus is specific for breakdown of related hydroxynitrile glucosides, such as rhodiocyanoside A. By contrast, BGD2 can hydrolyze both cyanogenic glucosides and rhodiocyanosides. Our genetic analysis demonstrated specificity in the catabolic pathways for hydroxynitrile glucosides and implied specificity in their biosynthetic pathways as well. In addition, it has provided important tools for elucidating and potentially modifying cyanogenesis pathways in plants.},

This study examines the consequences of predation on the fitness of a pair of lacustrine stickleback species (Gasterosteus aculeatus complex) and their Fsub1/sub hybrids. Benthic sticklebacks are found in the littoral zone of lakes associated with vegetation and bare sediments, whereas limnetic sticklebacks spend most of their lives in the pelagic zone. The cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) is a major predator of sticklebacks and the only other fish species native to lakes containing both benthic and limnetic species. In pond experiments we found that the addition of these predators primarily impacted the survival of limnetics. By contrast, benthic survival was unaffected by trout addition. The result was that relative survival of benthics and limnetics was reversed in the presence of trout. The presence of trout had no effect on the rank order of parent species growth rates, with benthics always growing faster than limnetics. Fsub1/sub hybrids survived poorly relative to benthics and limnetics and their growth rates were intermediate regardless of treatment. The results implicate predation by trout in the divergence of the species but not through increased vulnerability of Fsub1/sub hybrids.},

abstract = {The rapidly increasing rate of urbanization has a major impact on the ecology and evolution of species. While increased temperatures are a key aspect of urbanization (“urban heat islands”), we have very limited knowledge whether this generates differentiation in thermal responses between rural and urban populations. In a common garden experiment, we compared the thermal performance curves (TPCs) for growth rate and mortality in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella from three urban and three rural populations. TPCs for growth rate shifted vertically, consistent with the faster–slower theoretical model whereby the cold-adapted rural larvae grew faster than the warm-adapted urban larvae across temperatures. In line with costs of rapid growth, rural larvae showed lower survival than urban larvae across temperatures. The relatively lower temperatures hence expected shorter growing seasons in rural populations compared to the populations in the urban heat islands likely impose stronger time constraints to reach a certain developmental stage before winter, thereby selecting for faster growth rates. In addition, higher predation rates at higher temperature may have contributed to the growth rate differences between urban and rural ponds. A faster–slower differentiation in TPCs may be a widespread pattern along the urbanization gradient. The observed microgeographic differentiation in TPCs supports the view that urbanization may drive life-history evolution. Moreover, because of the urban heat island effect, urban environments have the potential to aid in developing predictions on the impact of climate change on rural populations.},

abstract = {Levels of genetic differentiation between populations can be highly variable across the genome, with divergent selection contributing to such heterogeneous genomic divergence. For example, loci under divergent selection and those tightly physically linked to them may exhibit stronger differentiation than neutral regions with weak or no linkage to such loci. Divergent selection can also increase genome-wide neutral differentiation by reducing gene flow (e.g. by causing ecological speciation), thus promoting divergence via the stochastic effects of genetic drift. These consequences of divergent selection are being reported in recently accumulating studies that identify: (i) 'outlier loci' with higher levels of divergence than expected under neutrality, and (ii) a positive association between the degree of adaptive phenotypic divergence and levels of molecular genetic differentiation across population pairs ['isolation by adaptation' (IBA)]. The latter pattern arises because as adaptive divergence increases, gene flow is reduced (thereby promoting drift) and genetic hitchhiking increased. Here, we review and integrate these previously disconnected concepts and literatures. We find that studies generally report 5-10{\%} of loci to be outliers. These selected regions were often dispersed across the genome, commonly exhibited replicated divergence across different population pairs, and could sometimes be associated with specific ecological variables. IBA was not infrequently observed, even at neutral loci putatively unlinked to those under divergent selection. Overall, we conclude that divergent selection makes diverse contributions to heterogeneous genomic divergence. Nonetheless, the number, size, and distribution of genomic regions affected by selection varied substantially among studies, leading us to discuss the potential role of divergent selection in the growth of regions of differentiation (i.e. genomic islands of divergence), a topic in need of future investigation.},

abstract = {Despite the potential importance of divergent reproductive phenologies as a barrier to gene flow, we know less about the genetics of this factor than we do about any other isolating barrier. Here, we report on the genetic architecture of divergent flowering phenologies that result in substantial reproductive isolation between the naturally hybridizing plant species Iris fulva and I. brevicaulis. I. fulva initiates and terminates flowering significantly earlier than I. brevicaulis. We examined line crosses of reciprocal F1 and backcross (BC1) hybrids and determined that flowering time was polygenic in nature. We further defined quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect the initiation of flowering in each of these species. QTL analyses were performed separately for two different growing seasons in the greenhouse, as well as in two field plots where experimental plants were placed into nature. For BCIF hybrids (BC1 toward I. fulva), 14 of 17 detected QTL caused flowering to occur later in the season when I. brevicaulis alleles were present, while the remaining 3 caused flowering to occur earlier. In BCIB hybrids (BC1 toward I. brevicaulis), 11 of 15 detected QTL caused flowering to occur earlier in the season when introgressed I. fulva alleles were present, while the remaining 4 caused flowering to occur later. These ratios are consistent with expectations of selection (as opposed to drift) promoting flowering divergence in the evolutionary history of these species. Furthermore, epistatic interactions among the QTL also reflected the same trends, with the majority of epistatic effects causing later flowering than expected in BCIF hybrids and earlier flowering in BCIB hybrids. Overlapping QTL that influenced flowering time across all four habitat/treatment types were not detected, indicating that increasing the sample size of genotyped plants would likely increase the number of significant QTL found in this study.},

abstract = {Despite the great anthropogenic interference on urban streams, information is still scarce about the genetic variability and structure of native fish populations inhabiting such streams. In the present study, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to analyze genetic variability and structure of populations assigned to the Neotropical fish species Astyanax scabripinnis from an urban stream located in Londrina, Parana State, southern Brazil. Thirty individuals of this species were collected from three sites throughout the upper Cambe stream. A total of 10 primers amplified 159 loci, of which 128 (80.5{\%}) were polymorphic. Each of the three populations showed very similar proportions of polymorphic loci, which ranged from 63.5 to 64.8{\%}. Unbiased genetic distances varied from 0.0612 to 0.0646. Theta(p)-test values indicated moderate to high genetic differentiation among individuals from different localities. The number of migrants varied from 1.34 to 1.46, suggesting a low gene flow between populations. The genetic similarity among all individuals studied ranged from 0.424 to 0.848. The results suggest that populations of A. scabripinnis in Cambe stream are undergoing genetic differentiation.},

abstract = {Over the years, the evolutionary importance of natural hybridization has been a contentious issue. At one extreme is the relatively common view of hy- bridization as an evolutionarily unimportant process. A less common perspective, but one that has gained support over the past decade, is that of hybridization as a rela- tively widespread and potentially creative evolutionary process. Indeed, studies docu- menting the production of hybrid genotypes exhibiting a wide range of fitnesses have become increasingly common. In this review, we examine the genetic basis of such variation in hybrid fitness. In particular, we assess the genetic architecture of hybrid inferiority (both sterility and inviability). We then extend our discussion to the genetic basis of increased fitness in certain hybrid genotypes. The available evidence argues that hybrid inferiority is the result of widespread negative epistasis in a hybrid ge- netic background. In contrast, increased hybrid fitness can be most readily explained through the segregation of additive genetic factors, with epistasis playing a more limited role.},

abstract = {Theories of adaptation typically ignore the effect of environmental change on population size. But some environmental challenges--challenges to which populations must adapt--may depress absolute fitness below 1, causing populations to decline. Under this scenario, adaptation is a race; beneficial alleles that adapt a population to the new environment must sweep to high frequency before the population becomes extinct. We derive simple, though approximate, solutions to the probability of successful adaptation (population survival) when adaptation involves new mutations, the standing genetic variation, or a mixture of the two. Our results show that adaptation to such environmental challenges can be difficult when relying on new mutations at one or a few loci, and populations will often decline to extinction.},

abstract = {Species which have settled in urban environments are exposed to different conditions from their wild conspecifics. A previous comparative study of an urban and a forest-living European blackbird population had revealed a three weeks earlier onset of gonadal growth in urban individuals. These physiological adjustments are either the result of genetic differences that have evolved during the urbanization process, or of phenotypic flexibility resulting from the bird's exposure to the different environmental conditions of town or forest. To identify which of these two mechanisms causes the differences in reproductive timing, hand-reared birds originating from the urban and the forest populations were kept in identical conditions. The substantial differences in the timing of reproduction between urban and forest birds known from the field did not persist under laboratory conditions, indicating that temporal differences in reproductive timing between these two populations are mainly a result of phenotypic flexibility. Nevertheless, urban males initiated plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and testicular development earlier than forest males in their first reproductive season. Moreover, plasma LH concentration and follicle size declined earlier in urban females than in forest females, suggesting that genetic differences are also involved and might contribute to the variations in the timing of reproduction in the wild.},

Evolutionary theory postulates that the loss or death of propagules during dispersal episodes (cost of dispersal) should select against dispersal. The cost of dispersal is expected to be a strong selective force in fragmented habitats. We analyzed patchy populations of the weed Crepis sancta occupying small patches on sidewalks, around trees planted within the city of Montpellier (South of France), to investigate the recent evolutionary consequences of the cost of dispersal. C. sancta produces both dispersing and nondispersing seeds. First, we showed that, in urban patches, dispersing seeds have a 55{\%} lower chance of settling in their patch compared with nondispersing seeds and, thus, fall on a concrete matrix unsuitable for germination. Second, we showed that the proportion of nondispersing seeds in urban patches measured in a common environment is significantly higher than in surrounding, unfragmented populations. Third, by using a quantitative genetic model, we estimated that the pattern is consistent with short-term evolution that occurs over approximately 5-12 generations of selection, which is generated by a high cost of dispersal in urban populations. This study shows that a high cost of dispersal after recent fragmentation causes rapid evolution toward lower dispersal.},

Additionally, DNA sequencing revealed significant variability among common ragweed ALS alleles. Two fragments of ALS were sequenced from three plants each of the Claire City and Dunkirk populations, totaling 688 nucleotide base pairs, of which 72 were polymorphic.

abstract = {AbstractShould the tape of life be replayed, would it produce similar living beings? A classical answer has long been ‘no', but accumulating data are now challenging this view. Repeatability in experimental evolution, in phenotypic evolution of diverse species and in the genes underlying phenotypic evolution indicates that despite unpredictability at the level of basic evolutionary processes (such as apparition of mutations), a certain kind of predictability can emerge at higher levels over long time periods. For instance, a survey of the alleles described in the literature that cause non-deleterious phenotypic differences among animals, plants and yeasts indicates that similar phenotypes have often evolved in distinct taxa through independent mutations in the same genes. Does this mean that the range of possibilities for evolution is limited? Does this mean that we can predict the outcomes of a replayed tape of life? Imagining other possible paths for evolution runs into four important issues: (i) resolving the influence of contingency, (ii) imagining living organisms that are different from the ones we know, (iii) finding the relevant concepts for predicting evolution, and (iv) estimating the probability of occurrence for complex evolutionary events that occurred only once during the evolution of life on earth.},

abstract = {We analyzed the rate at which postzygotic incompatibilities accumulate in birds. Our purposes were to assess the role of intrinsic F1 hybrid infertility and inviability in the speciation process, and to compare rates of loss of fertility and viability between the sexes. Among our sample more than half the crosses between species in the same genus produce fertile hybrids. Complete loss of F1 hybrid fertility takes on the order of millions of years. Loss of F1 hybrid viability occurs over longer timescales than fertility: some viable hybrids have been produced between taxa that appear to have been separated for more than 55 my. There is strong support for Haldane's rule, with very few examples where the male has lower fitness than the female. However, in contrast to Drosophila, fertility of the homogametic sex in the F1 appears to be lost before viability of the heterogametic sex in the F1. We conclude that the time span of loss of intrinsic hybrid fertility and viability is often, but not always, longer than the time to speciation. Premating isolation is an important mechanism maintaining reproductive isolation in birds. In addition, other factors causing postzygotic reproductive isolation such as ecological causes of hybrid unfitness, reduced mating success of hybrids, and genetic incompatibilities in the F2s and backcrosses may often be involved in the speciation process.},

Here, we compiled the largest global dataset to date of two diverse taxa in cities: birds (54 cities) and plants (110 cities). We found that the majority of urban bird and plant species are native in the world's cities. Few plants and birds are cosmopolitan, the most common being Columba livia and Poa annua. The density of bird and plant species (the number of species per km(2)) has declined substantially: only 8{\%} of native bird and 25{\%} of native plant species are currently present compared with estimates of non-urban density of species. The current density of species in cities and the loss in density of species was best explained by anthropogenic features (landcover, city age) rather than by non-anthropogenic factors (geography, climate, topography). As urbanization continues to expand, efforts directed towards the conservation of intact vegetation within urban landscapes could support higher concentrations of both bird and plant species. Despite declines in the density of species, cities still retain endemic native species, thus providing opportunities for regional and global biodiversity conservation, restoration and education.},

For example, the theory of punctuated equilibrium proposes that phenotypic change typically occurs in rapid bursts associated with speciation events. However, recent phylogenetic studies have found little evidence linking these processes in nature. Here we demonstrate that rates of species diversification are highly correlated with the rate of body size evolution across the 30,000+ living species of ray-finned fishes that comprise the majority of vertebrate biological diversity. This coupling is a general feature of fish evolution and transcends vast differences in ecology and body-plan organization. Our results may reflect a widespread speciational mode of character change in living fishes. Alternatively, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phenotypic 'evolvability'-the capacity of organisms to evolve-shapes the dynamics of speciation through time at the largest phylogenetic scales.},

Using a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) representing 85{\%} of the genome of the wild species Lycopersicon hirsutum (Solanum habrochaites) in the genetic background of the cultivated tomato L. esculentum (S. lycopersicum), we found that hybrid pollen and seed infertility are each based on 5-11 QTL that individually reduce hybrid fitness by 36-90{\%}. Seed infertility QTL act additively or recessively, consistent with findings in other systems where incompatibility loci have largely been recessive. Genetic lengths of introgressed chromosomal segments explain little of the variation for hybrid incompatibility among NILs, arguing against an infinitesimal model of hybrid incompatibility and reinforcing our inference of a limited number of discrete incompatibility factors between these species. In addition, male (pollen) and other (seed) incompatibility factors are roughly comparable in number. The latter two findings contrast strongly with data from Drosophila where hybrid incompatibility can be highly polygenic and complex, and male sterility evolves substantially faster than female sterility or hybrid inviability. The observed differences between Lycopersicon and Drosophila might be due to differences in sex determination system, reproductive and mating biology, and/or the prevalence of sexual interactions such as sexual selection.},

abstract = {Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses in the plant family Onagraceae support the need for revisions in the family classification. In this paper we briefly survey the history of generic and suprageneric classification in Onagraceae, summarize our knowledge of the morphological and molecular variation in the family in a phylogenetic context, and propose a revised classification that reflects that phylogeny. We include a specieslevel synopsis of the family, incorporating all nomenclatural changes and combinations but not full species-level synonymy. We provide descriptions of all taxa recognized for the first time, as well as tribes, genera, sections, subsections, and series. In this treatment, we recognize 22 genera in the family, subdivided into two subfamilies, subfam. Ludwigioideae (only Ludwigia) and subfam. Onagroideae (the other genera), and the latter into six tribes, two with only one genus each, three with two genera each, and one (tribe Onagreae) with 13 genera. Chromosome numbers and breeding system information are summarized, as is the geographical and ecological distribution of each taxon. For each group we list the included taxa. Many changes involve the tribe Onagreae, from which we have segregated Gongylocarpus as its own tribe, sister to the tribes Epilobieae and Onagreae, and within which we propose changes in the delimitation of Camissonia and Oenothera. Camissonia as currently defined is broadly paraphyletic; our new classification recognizes nine generic lineages (Camissonia, Camissoniopsis, Chylismia, Chylismiella, Eremothera, Eulobus, Holmgrenia, Taraxia, and Tetrapteron), which in part form a grade at the base of Oenothera. Each of these lineages is well-supported by morphological and molecular data. In contrast, molecular and morphological data both suggest the need to broaden the delimitation of Oenothera to include Calylophus, Gaura, and Stenosiphon. This redefined Oenothera, strongly supported by molecular data, is marked by at least two morphological synapomorphies: the presence of an indusium on the style, and a lobed or peltate stigma. We summarize these new generic alignments and review the morphological characters used to diagnose all tribes, genera, and sections. New taxa recognized include subfamilies Ludwigioideae and Onagroideae, two genera (Camissoniopsis and Holmgrenia), three sections (Epilobium sect. Macrocarpa, Oenothera sect. Leucocoryne, and O. sect. Xanthocoryne), and one subspecies (O. macrocarpa subsp. mexicana).

abstract = {The estimation of genetic correlations is central to the study of evolutionary change in populations. However, sample sizes required to achieve a small standard error are typically enormous. This precludes large-scale comparative analyses. Cheverud has conjectured that in some circumstances the phenotypic correlation can be substituted for the genetic correlation. This suggestion is examined using a large set of morphological traits in the sand cricket, Gryllus firmus. In this case the difference between the two estimates is very small. Further, by simulation it is shown that the phenotypic correlations are as good as, or better than, the estimated genetic correlations as estimates of the true genetic correlations. Examination of other data sets of morphological traits suggests that the phenotypic correlation may, in general, be a suitable substitute for the estimated genetic correlation. However, because the number of such examinations is still small, a protocol is suggested in which two sets of genetic analyses are undertaken to confirm the assumption in a large comparative analysis.},

abstract = {Two different, but related, evolutionary theories pertaining to phenotypic plasticity were proposed by James Mark Baldwin and Conrad Hal Waddington. Unfortunately, these theories are often confused with one another. Baldwin's notion of organic selection posits that plasticity influences whether an individual will survive in a new environment, thus dictating the course of future evolution. Heritable variations can then be selected upon to direct phenotypic evolution (i.e., "orthoplasy"). The combination of these two processes (organic selection and orthoplasy) is now commonly referred to as the "Baldwin effect." Alternately, Waddington's genetic assimilation is a process whereby an environmentally induced phenotype, or "acquired character," becomes canalized through selection acting upon the developmental system. Genetic accommodation is a modern term used to describe the process of heritable changes that occur in response to a novel induction. Genetic accommodation is a key component of the Baldwin effect, and genetic assimilation is a type of genetic accommodation. I here define both the Baldwin effect and genetic assimilation in terms of genetic accommodation, describe cases in which either should occur in nature, and propose that each could play a role in evolutionary diversification.

Consequently, historical and ecological studies must be integrated to understand why communities are structured as they are. Examples from Caribbean Anolis assemblages indicate the unique ecological insight a historical perspective can provide. In the Lesser Antilles, phylogenetic analysis indicates that character displacement probably has occurred, but perhaps only once, and that patterns of size dissimilarity across islands result from ecological size assortment subsequent to the evolutionary change in size. In the Greater Antilles, not only are communities composed of a suite of convergent "ecomorphs," but the buildup of multispecies communities has followed a very similar trajectory, a finding not demonstrable by nonhistorical analyses. Further, phylogenetic analyses suggest the appropriate direction for ecological research concerning the occurrence of "empty niches.".},

abstract = {Abstract Although land-use changes such as urbanization have dramatically altered plant-pollinator interactions, little is known about their effects on pollen limitation and floral traits. In this study, we examined pollinator visit frequency, reproductive success, and floral trait measurements in 12 populations of the annual andromonoecious Commelina communis in an urban-rural area. Pollinator and mate availability decreased significantly with developed land area around the study site. Most urbanized populations suffered from significant pollinator-limited male and/or female reproductive success. High fruit set in urbanized populations may suggest the presence of high reproductive assurance by selfing. The stigma height and degree of herkogamy significantly decreased with increased pollinator limitation. Petal length, anther height, and/or the pollen∶ovule ratio tended to be low in pollinator- and mate-limited urban populations. One urban population with high pollinator availability had flowers with higher herkogamy and stigma height compared to rural populations. These results suggest that urbanization may provide diverse selective forces that could affect the phenotypic variation in floral traits. CR  - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2014 The University of Chicago},

abstract = {The interaction between floral traits and reproductive isolation is crucial to explaining the extraordinary diversity of angiosperms. Heterostyly, a complex floral polymorphism that optimizes outcrossing, evolved repeatedly and has been shown to accelerate diversification in primroses, yet its potential influence on isolating mechanisms remains unexplored. Furthermore, the relative contribution of pre- versus postmating barriers to reproductive isolation is still debated. No experimental study has yet evaluated the possible effects of heterostyly on pre- and postmating reproductive mechanisms. We quantify multiple reproductive barriers between the heterostylous Primula elatior (oxlip) and P. vulgaris (primrose), which readily hybridize when co-occurring, and test whether traits of heterostyly contribute to reproductive barriers in unique ways. We find that premating isolation is key for both species, while postmating isolation is considerable only for P. vulgaris; ecogeographic isolation is crucial for both species, while phenological, seed developmental, and hybrid sterility barriers are also important in P. vulgaris, implicating sympatrically higher gene flow into P. elatior. We document for the first time that, in addition to the aforementioned species-dependent asymmetries, morph-dependent asymmetries affect reproductive barriers between heterostylous species. Indeed, the interspecific decrease of reciprocity between high sexual organs of complementary floral morphs limits interspecific pollen transfer from anthers of short-styled flowers to stigmas of long-styled flowers, while higher reciprocity between low sexual organs favors introgression over isolation from anthers of long-styled flowers to stigmas of short-styled flowers. Finally, intramorph incompatibility persists across species boundaries, but is weakened in long-styled flowers of P. elatior, opening a possible backdoor to gene flow through intramorph pollen transfer between species. Therefore, patterns of gene flow across species boundaries are likely affected by floral morph composition of adjacent populations. To summarize, our study highlights the general importance of premating isolation and newly illustrates that both morph- and species-dependent asymmetries shape boundaries between heterostylous species.},

It may adapt either through new beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the population or by using alleles from the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenario—standing variation vs. new mutations—is more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of “soft sweeps,” where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high.},

Using a hemiparasitic plant that takes up secondary compounds from host plants, I experimentally manipulated secondary compounds in planta and assessed their effects on herbivores and pollinators in the field. Here, I show that the uptake of alkaloids in the annual hemiparasite Castilleja indivisa resulted in decreased herbivory, increased visitation by pollinators, and increased lifetime seed production. These results indicate that resistance traits such as alkaloids can increase plant fitness directly by reducing herbivore attack and indirectly by increasing pollinator visitation to defended plants. Thus, selection for production of secondary compounds may be underestimated by considering only the direct effect of herbivores on plant fitness.},

Few studies have examined the entire range of possible isolation barriers from geographic isolation to next generation hybrid viability. Here, we present a detailed analysis of isolation barriers between two flowering plant species of the genus Petunia (Solanaceae). Petunia integrifolia and P. axillaris feature divergent pollination syndromes but can produce fertile hybrids when crossed in the laboratory. Both Petunia species are primarily isolated in space but appear not to hybridize in sympatry. Our experiments demonstrate that pollinator isolation is very high but not strong enough to explain the absence of hybrids in nature. However, pollinator isolation in conjunction with male gametic isolation (i.e., pollen-pistil interaction) can explain the lack of natural hybridization, while postzygotic isolation barriers are low or nonexistent. Our study supports the notion that reproductive isolation in flowering plants is mainly caused by pre- rather than postzygotic isolation mechanisms.},

abstract = {A paradigm of evolutionary biology is that adaptation and reproductive isolation are caused by a nearly infinite number of mutations of individually small effect. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the genetic basis of pollinator discrimination in two closely related species of monkeyflowers that differ in their major pollinators. This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate the genetic architecture of adaptation and speciation because floral traits that confer pollinator specificity also contribute to premating reproductive isolation. We asked: (i) What floral traits cause pollinator discrimination among plant species? and (ii) What is the genetic basis of these traits? We examined these questions by using data obtained from a large-scale field experiment where genetic markers were employed to determine the genetic basis of pollinator visitation. Observations of F2 hybrids produced by crossing bee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii with hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis revealed that bees preferred large flowers low in anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments, whereas hummingbirds favored nectar-rich flowers high in anthocyanins. An allele that increases petal carotenoid concentration reduced bee visitation by 80{\%}, whereas an allele that increases nectar production doubled hummingbird visitation. These results suggest that genes of large effect on pollinator preference have contributed to floral evolution and premating reproductive isolation in these monkeyflowers. This work contributes to growing evidence that adaptation and reproductive isolation may often involve major genes.},

Nineteen study sites in the Swiss Alps included pure sites and contact sites (both taxa present within 30 m).

This indicates that although the two taxa are weakly differentiated, current introgression has not led to genome-wide admixture. Only three putative early generation hybrids were detected at contact sites. The habitats of the two taxa differed between pure sites with S. dioica occurring in moister, colder, and less-disturbed sites than S. latifolia. However, asymmetric habitat overlap was evident within contact sites found in intermediate conditions that were more similar to S. latifolia sites. This situation might favor introgression from S. dioica into S. latifolia. Evidence for habitat-genotype associations within contact sites was weak making habitat-mediated selection against intermediate phenotypes of hybrids unlikely in the contact sites investigated. We suggest that other reproductive barriers together with dispersal limitation contribute to the rarity of early generation hybrids.},

abstract = {Plant species vary greatly in defenses against herbivores, but existing theory has struggled to explain this variation. Here, we test how phylogenetic relatedness, tradeoffs, trait syndromes, and sexual reproduction affect the macroevolution of defense. To examine the macroevolution of defenses, we studied 26 Oenothera (Onagraceae) species, combining chemistry, comparative phylogenetics and experimental assays of resistance against generalist and specialist herbivores. We detected dozens of phenolic metabolites within leaves, including ellagitannins (ETs), flavonoids, and caffeic acid derivatives (CAs). The concentration and composition of phenolics exhibited low to moderate phylogenetic signal. There were clear negative correlations between multiple traits, supporting the prediction of allocation tradeoffs. There were also positively covarying suites of traits, but these suites did not strongly predict resistance to herbivores and thus did not act as defensive syndromes. By contrast, specific metabolites did correlate with the performance of generalist and specialist herbivores. Finally, that repeated losses of sex in Oenothera was associated with the evolution of increased flavonoid diversity and altered phenolic composition. These results show that secondary chemistry has evolved rapidly during the diversification of Oenothera. This evolution has been marked by allocation tradeoffs between traits, some of which are related to herbivore performance. The repeated loss of sex appears also to have constrained the evolution of plant secondary chemistry, which may help to explain variation in defense among plants.},

This does not seem to be the result, to any great extent, of seasonal changes or identification problems, but appears to be largely due to overlooking and partly a result of relocation prob lems. The overall percentage agreement between surveyors was 57{\%}, also comparable with other studies.},

abstract = {In habitats disturbed by anthropogenic noise, acoustically communicating species may develop behavioral responses that help them transmit information and overcome signal masking. We studied four anuran species breeding in wetlands, ponds, and ditches near a highway in eastern Ontario, Canada, to test whether they called more often when traffic noise intensity was lower, and stopped calling when the noise intensity increased (i.e., gap calling behavior). We made call recordings between April and July 2011, and compared the traffic noise intensity (sound pressure level) between times when the anurans were calling and times when they were not calling.We found that the two species with the highest call peak frequency (American toad, gray treefrog) called randomly with regard to traffic noise intensity. In contrast, the two species with the lowest call peak frequency (green frog, bullfrog) called more often when traffic noise intensity was low. The behavioral response in the two latter species likely represents a short-term strategy that enhances their signal-to-noise ratio thereby increasing the chance of effective communication. Our results support predictions derived from the acoustic adaptation hypothesis: low-frequency signals are more prone to be masked by anthropogenic noise and therefore require behavioral adjustments (in this study gap-calling behavior) to ameliorate this effect.},

abstract = {Induced by global warming, mountain plant species are migrating upwards. Species inhabiting the nival zone of today are threatened by competitors which move from the alpine zone towards the summits. The manner in which species move depends on their abilities to cope with microtopographical situations. We present a spatially explicit predictive model which draws scenarios of future species distribution patterns at a typical high mountain of the European Alps. The altitudinal temperature gradient is examined. Based on the lapse rate and on definitions of topographical niches of species, a +1 degreeC- and a +2 degreeC-warming scenario are modelled using a fine-scaled digital elevation model. Nival species will lose area and become restricted to specific topographical situations. Alpine and subnival grassland species are predicted to expand their area, mainly along stable surface situations. Whether the migration will take place as a filling or a moving process is specific to the particular species. Overall, biodiversity is apparently not threatened on the decadal scale. In special cases, however, genetic losses are likely both on a local and on a regional scale.},

I investigated whether changes in timing and rate of growth were a source of phenotypic variation in a putative incipient species group of pupfish (Cyprinodon spp.). On San Salvador Island, Bahamas, sympatric forms of pupfish differ in morphology but show only partial reproductive isolation in the laboratory. Offspring from two forms and two geographical areas and their hybrids were bred in the laboratory, and ontogenetic trajectories of their feeding morphology were followed until maturity. In the Bahamian pupfish the two forms grow along similar size but not shape trajectories. Two heterochronic parameters, onset and rate of growth, alter shape trajectories in the Bahamian pupfish. Similar forms from different geographical areas (Florida and the Bahamas) grow along parallel shape trajectories, differing only in one heterochronic parameter, the onset shape. Hybrids within and between the pupfish forms produced intermediate feeding morphologies that were influenced by their maternal phenotype, suggesting that maternal effects may be a source of phenotypic variation in shape that can persist to maturity. In Cyprinodon, small changes in multiple heterochronic parameters translate into large phenotypic differences in feeding morphology.},

abstract = {9 Evolutionary rescue describes a situation where adaptive evolution prevents the extinction of a 10 population facing a stressing environment. Models of evolutionary rescue could in principle be 11 used to predict the treatment levels most likely to limit the emergence of resistance in pests or 12 pathogens. Stress levels are known to affect both the rate of decline of the population 13 (demographic effect) and the speed of adaptation to the stressing environment (evolutionary 14 effect), but the latter aspect has received less attention. Here, we derive a model of evolutionary 15 rescue that includes both effects, using Fisher's Geometric Model of adaptation. In this model, 16 the fitness effects of mutations depend both on the genotype and environment in which they 17 arise. In particular, the model introduces a dependence between the proportion of rescue 18 mutants, or their cost, and the level of stress. Analytic results were obtained under a strong 19 selection weak mutation regime, and their accuracy was tested by simulations. Stress can affect 20 different parameters of the fitness landscape in our model, which are amenable to empirical 21 measurements. These effects can be summarized into a single composite parameter, measuring 22 stress intensity. Using this composite parameter, we describe a narrow 'characteristic stress 23 window' of stress levels, over which the rescue probability drops from very likely to very 24 unlikely. The rescue probability drops more sharply with increasing stress than in previous 25 models without context-dependent mutation. We discuss how to test these predictions with 26 rescue experiments across gradients of stress. 27 28 Introduction},

abstract = {Biological invasions are regarded as threats to global biodiversity. Among invasive aliens, a number of plant species belonging to the genera Myriophyllum, Ludwigia and Cabomba, and to the Hydrocharitaceae family pose a particular ecological threat to water bodies. Therefore, one would try to prevent them from entering a country. However, many related species are commercially traded, and distinguishing invasive from non-invasive species based on morphology alone is often difficult for plants in a vegetative stage. In this regard, DNA barcoding could become a good alternative. In this study, 242 samples belonging to 26 species from 10 genera of aquatic plants were assessed using the chloroplast loci trnH-psbA, matK and rbcL. Despite testing a large number of primer sets and several PCR protocols, the matK locus could not be amplified or sequenced reliably and therefore was left out of the analysis. Using the other two loci, eight invasive species could be distinguished from their respective related species, a ninth one failed to produce sequences of sufficient quality. Based on the criteria of universal application, high sequence divergence and level of species discrimination, the trnH-psbA noncoding spacer was the best performing barcode in the aquatic plant species studied. Thus, DNA barcoding may be helpful with enforcing a ban on trade of such invasive species, such as is already in place in the Netherlands. This will become even more so once DNA barcoding would be turned into machinery routinely operable by a nonspecialist in botany and molecular genetics.},

For these reasons, island research provides valuable insights into speciation and adaptive radiation, and into the relative importance of contingency and determinism in evolutionary diversification.},

abstract = {Many organisms have evolved tolerance to natural and human-generated toxins. Reid et al. performed a genomic analysis of killifish, geographically separate and independent populations of which have adapted recently to severe pollution (see the Perspective by Tobler and Culumber). Sequencing multiple sensitive and resistant populations revealed signals of selective sweeps for variants that may confer tolerance to toxins, some of which were shared between resistant populations. Thus, high genetic diversity in killifish seems to allow selection to act on existing variation, driving rapid adaptation to selective forces such as pollution.Science, this issue p. 1305; see also p. 1232Atlantic killifish populations have rapidly adapted to normally lethal levels of pollution in four urban estuaries. Through analysis of 384 whole killifish genome sequences and comparative transcriptomics in four pairs of sensitive and tolerant populations, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor–based signaling pathway as a shared target of selection. This suggests evolutionary constraint on adaptive solutions to complex toxicant mixtures at each site. However, distinct molecular variants apparently contribute to adaptive pathway modification among tolerant populations. Selection also targets other toxicity-mediating genes and genes of connected signaling pathways; this indicates complex tolerance phenotypes and potentially compensatory adaptations. Molecular changes are consistent with selection on standing genetic variation. In killifish, high nucleotide diversity has likely been a crucial substrate for selective sweeps to propel rapid adaptation.},

abstract = {Hybrid sterility and inviability often result from the accumulation of substitutions that, while functional on their normal genetic backgrounds, cause a loss of fitness when brought together in hybrids. Previous theory has shown that such Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities should accumulate at least as fast as the square of the number of substitutions separating two species, the so-called snowball effect. Here we explicitly describe the stochastic accumulation of these incompatibilities as a function of time. The accumulation of these incompatibilities involves three levels of stochasticity: (1) the number of substitutions separating two allopatric lineages at a given time; (2) the number of incompatibilities resulting from these substitutions; and (3) the fitness effects of individual incompatibilities. Previous analyses ignored the stochasticity of molecular evolution (level 1) as well as that due to the variable effects of incompatibilities (level 3). Here we approximate the full stochastic process characterizing the accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities between pairs of loci. We derive the distribution of the number of incompatibilities as a function of divergence time between allopatric taxa as well as the distribution of waiting times to speciation by postzygotic isolation. We provide simple approximations for the mean and variance of these waiting times. These results let us estimate. albeit crudely, the probability, p, that two diverged sites from different species will contribute to hybrid sterility or inviability. Our analyses of data from Drosophila and Bombina suggest that p is generally very small, on the order of 10(-6) or less.},

abstract = {The question of how new species originate and adapt to novel environments has been foundational to the field of evolutionary biology 1 . The merging of Darwinian principles with Mendelian genetics in the 'Modern Synthesis' during the first half of the twentieth century laid the conceptual foundation for the field of speci­ ation genetics 2,3 , which has the objective of elucidating the molecular underpinnings of species formation. This quest has trad itionally been dominated by studies on postzygotic intrinsic isolation that make use of genetic crosses of diverged species in laboratory model systems such as Drosophila, Arabidopsis or Saccharomyces spe­ cies 4,5 . At the same time, it has long been recognized that genetic studies are most insightful when they further our understanding of the evolutionary forces that shape natural genetic variation 2,6 . The rapid development of high­throughput sequencing technologies during the past decade has opened this avenue, and speciation genetic research has expanded into wild populations 7,8 . Genome­wide investigation in natural populations is now possible in essentially any organism of choice. By studying patterns of segregating genetic variation across the genomes of multiple individuals sampled in their natural environment, evolutionary processes gov­ erning the accumulation of genetic differences between incipient evolutionary lineages can be 'caught in the act' . In conjunction with ecological and behavioural investi gations, genome­wide population surveys hold great promise to provide essential information on the bio geographic history of species 9,10 and address long­ standing questions in speciation research. For exam­ ple, how common is speciation with gene flow (BOX 1)? What is the genetic architecture of reproductive barriers (BOX 2)? What is the timeline of speciation? What is the role of sex chromosomes? What role do chromosomal rearrangements have? In addition, population genomic data more generally contribute to our knowledge of genomic processes that need not be causally related to adaptation and speciation, but that leave 'footprints' that mimic or interfere with signals from adaptation or reproductive isolation 11 . Examples include evidence for recombination rate variation across the genome of individuals and species 12,13 , biased gene conversion 14 , the link between life history traits and genome evolution 15 , and the relative importance of genetic drift, background selection and genetic draft in shaping overall levels of genome­wide genetic diversity 16 . Although interesting in their own right, the genomic footprints generated by these processes complicate the interpretation of genome scans in the context of speciation 17–19 . Originally confined to studies of human evolution, genome scans lie at the core of speciation and adapta­ tion genomic approaches in natural populations 20 and have turned into an industry. It is tempting to draw par­ allels with the dramatically increased use of mitochon­ drial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and microsatellite genotyping in molecular ecology several decades ago. Population genomic studies using genome scans often build on the idea of a 'genic model of speciation' under conditions of gene flow (BOX 1). This model predicts that divergent selection against gene flow is initially confined to few genic elements 21–23 . Allelic variation at loci that are under selection and confer reproductive isolation will be less likely to cross population boundaries than},

Throughout most of the world, however, there are neither the resources nor the time to carry out detailed inventories for most taxa before designating protected areas. Site selection (on grounds other than availability) would be easier and more effective if two things were true: (1) habitats that are species-rich for one taxon are also species-rich for others5; and (2) rare species occur in, and therefore benefit from the conservation of, species-rich habitats. Diversity (usually, species richness) and the presence of rare species are the most frequently cited criteria for site selection by conservationists. Here, we use data on British plants and animals held by the Biological Records Centre (BRC) and the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), mapped on a grid of 10 km × 10 km ('10 km squares') to examine the extent to which species-rich areas for different taxa coincide, and whether species-rich areas contain substantial numbers of rare species. The fine scale and high intensity of recording in Britain produces distributional datasets at least as good as and, in most cases, better than those available elsewhere. For Britain at least, we do not find strong support for either proposition. Species-rich areas ('hotspots') frequently do not coincide for different taxa, and many rare species do not occur in the most species-rich squares.},

abstract = {Rhagoletis pomonella is a model for sympatric speciation (divergence without geographic isolation) by means of host-plant shifts. Many Rhagoletis species are known to use fruit odor as a key olfactory cue to distinguish among their respective host plants. Because Rhagoletis rendezvous on or near the unabscised fruit of their hosts to mate, behavioral preferences for fruit odor translate directly into premating reproductive isolation among flies. Here, we report that reciprocal F(1) hybrids between the apple and hawthorn host races of R. pomonella, as well as between the host races and an undescribed sibling species infesting Cornus florida (flowering dogwood) do not respond to host fruit volatiles in wind-tunnel assays at doses that elicit maximal directed flight in parental flies. The reduced ability of hybrids to orient to fruit volatiles could result from a conflict between neural pathways for preference and avoidance behaviors, and it suggests that hybrids might suffer a fitness disadvantage for finding fruit in nature. Therefore, host-specific mating may play a dual role as an important postzygotic as well as a premating reproductive barrier to isolate sympatric Rhagoletis flies.},

abstract = {The degree of phenotypic divergence and reproductive isolation between taxon pairs can vary quantitatively, and often increases as evolutionary divergence proceeds through various stages, from polymorphism to population differentiation, ecotype and race formation, speciation, and post-speciational divergence. Although divergent natural selection promotes divergence, it does not always result in strong differentiation. For example, divergent selection can fail to complete speciation, and distinct species pairs sometimes collapse ('speciation in reverse'). Widely-discussed explanations for this variability concern genetic architecture, and the geographic arrangement of populations. A less-explored possibility is that the degree of phenotypic and reproductive divergence between taxon pairs is positively related to the number of ecological niche dimensions (i.e., traits) subject to divergent selection. Some data supporting this idea stem from laboratory experimental evolution studies using Drosophila, but tests from nature are lacking. Here we report results from manipulative field experiments in natural populations of herbivorous Timema stick insects that are consistent with this 'niche dimensionality' hypothesis. In such insects, divergent selection between host plants might occur for cryptic colouration (camouflage to evade visual predation), physiology (to detoxify plant chemicals), or both of these niche dimensions. We show that divergent selection on the single niche dimension of cryptic colouration can result in ecotype formation and intermediate levels of phenotypic and reproductive divergence between populations feeding on different hosts. However, greater divergence between a species pair involved divergent selection on both niche dimensions. Although further replication of the trends reported here is required, the results suggest that dimensionality of selection may complement genetic and geographic explanations for the degree of diversification in nature.},

abstract = {Hybrids between species provide information about the evolutionary processes involved in divergence. In addition to creating hybrids in the laboratory, biologists can take advantage of natural hybrid zones to understand the factors that shape gene flow between divergent lineages. In the early stages of speciation, most regions of the genome continue to flow freely between populations. Alternatively, the subset of the genome that confers reproductive barriers between nascent species is expected to reject introgression. Now enabled by advances in genomics, this perspective is motivating detailed comparisons of gene flow across genomic regions in hybrid zones. Here, I review methods for measuring and interpreting introgression at multiple loci in hybrid zones, focusing on the problem of identifying loci that contribute to reproductive isolation. Emerging patterns from multi-locus studies of hybrid zones are highlighted, including remarkable variance in introgression across the genome. Although existing methods have been useful, there is scope for development of new analytical approaches that better connect differential patterns of gene flow in hybrid zones with current knowledge of speciation mechanisms. I outline future prospects for differential introgression studies on a genomic scale.},

They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and ma- rine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both dif- ferences in species mobility and in “established use.” Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hin- dering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty.},

abstract = {Genetically distinct anadromous (sockeye) and nonanadromous (kokanee) morphs of the Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, develop identical, brilliant red color at maturity during sympatric breeding in freshwater streams. The marine and lacustrine environments they occupy prior to maturity, however, appear to differ in the availability of dietary carotenoid pigments necessary to produce red coloration. We tested the hypothesis that kokanee, which occupy carotenoid-poor lakes, are more efficient at using the dietary pigments than are sockeye, which occupy the more productive North Pacific Ocean. In a 2-year controlled breeding study, flesh and skin color of mature and immature crosses fed a low-carotenoid diet were quantified with both a chromameter and by chemical extraction of carotenoid pigments. Results revealed striking countergradient variation in carotenoid use, with kokanee approximately three times more efficient at sequestering the pigments to the flesh musculature than similar age sockeye. This difference translated into virtually nonoverlapping differences between pure crosses in secondary sexual color at maturity, when the pigments are mobilized and transported to the skin. Kokanee crosses turned pinkish red over most of their body, whereas sockeye turned olive green. The olive green was similar to the breeding color of residuals in the wild, the progeny of anadromous sockeye that remain in fresh water and are believed to have given rise to kokanee on numerous independent occasions. Reciprocal hybrids were similar to each other and intermediate to the pure crosses, indicating additive genetic inheritance. Mate choice trials with sockeye males in the wild showed the ancestral morph strongly preferred red over green models. These results suggest a preference for red mates maintained in nonanadromous breeding populations drove the reevolution of the red phenotype in kokanee via more efficient use of dietary carotenoid pigments. This is a novel, yet hidden, mechanism by which sexual selection promotes the genetic differentiation of these sympatric populations.},

abstract = {The extent of convergent molecular evolution is largely unknown, yet is critical to understanding the genetics of adaptation. Target site insensitivity to cardenolides is a prime candidate for studying molecular convergence because herbivores in six orders of insects have specialized on these plant poisons, which gain their toxicity by blocking an essential transmembrane carrier, the sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase). We investigated gene sequences of the Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$-subunit in 18 insects feeding on cardenolide-containing plants (spanning 15 genera and four orders) to screen for amino acid substitutions that might lower sensitivity to cardenolides. The replacement N122H that was previously shown to confer resistance in the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and Chrysochus leaf beetles was found in four additional species, Oncopeltus fasciatus and Lygaeus kalmii (Heteroptera, Lygaeidae), Labidomera clivicollis (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), and Liriomyza asclepiadis (Diptera, Agromyzidae). Thus, across 300 Myr of insect divergence, specialization on cardenolide-containing plants resulted in molecular convergence for an adaptation likely involved in coevolution. Our screen revealed a number of other substitutions connected to cardenolide binding in mammals. We confirmed that some of the particular substitutions provide resistance to cardenolides by introducing five distinct constructs of the Drosophila melanogaster gene into susceptible eucaryotic cells under an ouabain selection regime. These functional assays demonstrate that combined substitutions of Q(111) and N(122) are synergistic, with greater than twofold higher resistance than either substitution alone and {\textgreater}12-fold resistance over the wild type. Thus, even across deep phylogenetic branches, evolutionary degrees of freedom seem to be limited by physiological constraints, such that the same molecular substitutions confer adaptation.},

abstract = {When birds settle in new environments, they may encounter different suites of nest-predators, resulting in strong selection to nest in novel locations. An important axis of variation is in height of nest placement, because off- ground nests are likely to be subject to different predation pressures than on-ground nests. In their native habitats, i.e. temperate montane forest, dark-eyed juncos Junco hyemalis predominantly nest on the ground. A population of juncos became established on the urban campus of the Univ. of California at San Diego in the early 1980s, and now has a relatively high frequency (20{\%}) of off-ground nests. Off-ground nesting is associated with strong fitness benefits: based on returns from 579 nests, an egg laid off the ground has 80{\%} higher chance of producing a recruit to the next generation than one laid on the ground. In addition, some nests were occasionally re-used by 10{\%} of females and off-ground nests were more likely to be re-used. Many females that bred off-ground also built an on-ground nests and we did not detect an association in nest site positions of mothers and daughters, implying low heritability of this novel nest placement trait. By contrast, certain territories consistently had on-ground nests irrespective of the identity of the breeding female. We suggest that a limitation of suitable off-ground nest sites for a species predominantly adapted to on-ground nesting greatly slows the rate of evolution of this trait.},

abstract = {The mean temperature of the growing season has been found to correlate with treeline position across the globe, but regional variation still needs to be explained. In the present study, we explored how the elevation of the alpine treeline varies with slope exposure and the distinct influence of the summer monsoon in the Three Parallel Rivers region of SW China (Yunnan). We hypothesized that the treeline elevation will not vary distinctly with slope exposure, because tree canopies are coupled to atmospheric conditions rather than ground temperature. We extracted treeline positions from Landsat TM images, DEM (digital elevation model) data and climatic data from Worldclim to analyze the relationship between treeline position and climate. The results revealed no significant exposure effect. Treeline elevations were almost the same at different slope exposure in each of these north–south stretching mountain ranges. Counter to expectation, south-facing slopes showed a slightly lower position than the others, which may be caused either by greater monsoon exposure (cloud cover) or human disturbance. The mean growing season temperature at treeline showed the same pattern as was obtained globally in earlier assessments (6.7 C). However, the treeline elevation (as well as the isotherm position) increased from west (wet) to east (drier) along the summer monsoon route. Our results confirmed the theory that the treeline is strongly associated with atmospheric circulation and does not benefit from greater radiative warming on south-facing slopes during the growing season. The common treeline isotherm hypothesis matches with treeline position in this monsoon-driven climate regime.},

abstract = {Urbanization is a severe form of habitat fragmentation that can cause many species to be locally extirpated and many others to become trapped and isolated within an urban matrix. The role of drift in reducing genetic diversity and increasing genetic differenti- ation is well recognized in urban populations. However, explicit incorporation and analysis of the demographic and temporal factors promoting drift in urban environ- ments are poorly studied. Here, we genotyped 15 microsatellites in 320 fire salaman- ders from the historical city of Oviedo (Est. 8th century) to assess the effects of time since isolation, demographic history (historical effective population size; Ne) and patch size on genetic diversity, population structure and contemporary Ne. Our results indi- cate that urban populations of fire salamanders are highly differentiated, most likely due to the recent Ne declines, as calculated in coalescence analyses, concomitant with the urban development of Oviedo. However, urbanization only caused a small loss of genetic diversity. Regression modelling showed that patch size was positively associ- ated with contemporary Ne, while we found only moderate support for the effects of demographic history when excluding populations with unresolved history. This high- lights the interplay between different factors in determining current genetic diversity and structure. Overall, the results of our study on urban populations of fire salaman- ders provide some of the very first insights into the mechanisms affecting changes in genetic diversity and population differentiation via drift in urban environments, a cru- cial subject in a world where increasing urbanization is forecasted.},

abstract = {The microdistribution of diploid and tetraploid plants of Dactylis glomerata L. was examined and related to their immediate environment in several sites in central Galicia, where morphologically indistinguishable individuals of both ploidies grow in sympatry. The two related cytotypes differed in habitat preference. Diploids were mainly confined to the low-density forest-floor habitat in woodlands of mostly ancient origin, whereas tetraploids were widespread in varied habitats but clearly predominant in open areas, particularly in disturbed anthropic sites. The in situ comparison of plant performance showed that where plants of each ploidy were more common they produced more tillers, panicles and seeds. This habitat preference closely reflected differences in life-history characteristics. The tetraploids had an early and short flowering time almost always completed before the aestival drought, whereas the diploids began to flower several weeks later and flowered throughout the drought. Comparisons along artificial gradients of soil water availability and light transmittance indicated that the cytotypes had distinct physiological requirements which probably originated in metabolic and more general genetic differentiation and could be directly attributable to ploidy. Habitat differentiation increases the species' colonizing ability. It also amplifies divergence in reproductive strategy between diploids and tetraploids, which reduces ineffective crossing between cytotypes and thereby permits them to coexist in sympatry. The effect of hybridization at the polyploid level on the differentiation between cytotypes was assessed from the recent introduction of a foreign tetraploid entity into the study area. Hybridization between the two distinct tetraploids was found to increase habitat differentiation between the diploids and the tetraploids, but the major part of this differentiation is probably attributable to ploidy itself.},

Today, the use of botanical raw material to produce pharmaceuticals, herbal remedies, teas, spirits, cosmetics, sweets, dietary supplements, special industrial compounds and crude materials constitute an important global resource in terms of healthcare and economy. In recent years, DNA barcoding has been suggested as a useful molecular technique to complement traditional taxonomic expertise for fast species identification and biodiversity inventories. In this study, in situ application of DNA barcodes was tested on a selected group of forest tree species with the aim of contributing to the identification, conservation and trade control of these valuable plant resources. The "core barcode" for land plants (rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) was tested on 68 tree specimens (24 taxa). Universality of the method, ease of data retrieval and correct species assignment using sequence character states, presence of DNA barcoding gaps and GenBank discrimination assessment were evaluated. The markers showed different prospects of reliable applicability. RbcL and trnH-psbA displayed 100{\%} amplification and sequencing success, while matK did not amplify in some plant groups. The majority of species had a single haplotype. The trnH-psbA region showed the highest genetic variability, but in most cases the high intraspecific sequence divergence revealed the absence of a clear DNA barcoding gap. We also faced an important limitation because the taxonomic coverage of the public reference database is incomplete. Overall, species identification success was 66.7{\%}. This work illustrates current limitations in the applicability of DNA barcoding to taxonomic forest surveys. These difficulties urge for an improvement of technical protocols and an increase of the number of sequences and taxa in public databases.},

abstract = {Reliably predicting vegetation distribution requires habitat distribution models (HDMs) that are ecologically sound. Current correlative HDMs are increasingly criticized because they lack suffi cient functional basis. To include functional information into these models, we integrated two concepts from community ecology into a new type of HDM. We incorporated: 1) species selection by their traits in which only those species that pass the environmental fi lter can be part of the community (assembly theory); 2) that the occurrence probability of a community is determined by the extent to which the community mean traits fi t the required traits as set by the environment. In this paper, our trait-based HDM is presented and its predictive capacity explored. Our approach consists of two steps. In step 1, four plant traits (stem-specifi c density and indicator values for nutrients, moisture and acidity) are predicted from four dominant environmental drivers (disturbance, nutrient supply, moisture supply and acidity) using regression. In step 2, these traits are used to predict the occurrence probability of 13 vegetation types, covering the majority of vegetation types across the Netherlands. Th e model was validated by comparison to the observed vegetation type for 263 plots in the Netherlands. Model performance was within the range of conventional HDMs and decreased with increasing uncertainty in the environment-trait relationships and with an increasing number of vegetation types. Th is study shows that including functionality into HDMs is not necessarily at the cost of model performance, while it has several conceptual advantages among including an increased insight in the functional characteristics of the vegetation and sources of unpredictability in community assembly. As such it is a promising fi rst step towards more functional HDMs. Further development of a trait-based HDM hinges on replacing indicator values by truly functional traits and the translation of these relationships into mechanistic relationships.},

We examined adaptation of embryo development time to seasonally cooling temperature in a population of pink salmon by estimating genetic components of variation in control and hybrid F-1 crosses made between members of early- and late-spawning subpopulations, and replicated our observations in independent odd- and even-year brood lines. In each brood line, both sire and dam components of variation of development time were significant and accounted for a substantially larger portion of variation than their interactions, which suggested that natural selection has acted primarily on additive genetic variation. The implications of these results are that (1) spatially or temporally proximate salmon populations may be structured by distinct adaptations; (2) artificial relaxation of local geneflow barriers may lead to depression of fitness; and (3) populations of salmon genetically structured by local adaptation may carry variation that enhances their persistence during rapid climate change.},

[n.b., they modelled linear frequency dependence, using an additional term of the form + b(x1/(x1+x2) - f1) in the LV model; b is the selection coeff., f1 is the neutral equilibrium frequency of population x1, where x1, x2 etc. are the numbers of individuals of cytotypes 1 and 2].  A new polyploid may persist by replacing its diploid parent as a result of the combination of a very small diploid population, the existence of an unstable equilibrium between the two cytotypes, and chance events (probably the most common route); by coexisting with it as the result of niche separation; or by outcompeting and replacing it (probably very rare). However, the conditions for all of these possibilities are quite restrictive. The model and results are applicable in some degree to the establishment of other novel cytotypes, and also to pairs of species that compete for resources and also experience minority disadvantage (perhaps because of competition for pollinators) with respect to each other.},

Resource availability in the environment is proposed as the major determinant of both the amount and type of plant defense. When resource are limited, plants with inherently slow growth are favored over those with fast growth rates; slow rates in turn favor large investments in antiherbivore defenses. Leaf lifetime, also determined by resource availability, affects the relative advantages of defenses with different turnover rates. Relative limitation of different resources also constrains the types of defenses. The proposals are compared with other theories on the evolution of plant defenses.},

Parallel speciation is a special form of parallel evolution where traits that determine reproductive isolation evolve repeatedly, in closely related populations, as by-products of adaptation to ecological conditions. The outcome of such parallel evolution is that ecologically divergent pairs of populations exhibit greater levels of reproductive isolation than ecologically similar pairs of populations of a similar or younger age. The parallel evolution of reproductive isolation provides strong evidence for natural selection in the process of speciation, but only one conclusive example from nature is known. Populations of the walking-stick insect Timema cristinae that use different host-plant species have diverged in body size and shape, host preference, behaviour and the relative frequency of two highly cryptic colour-pattern morphs. Here we report that divergent selection for host adaptation, and not genetic drift, has promoted the parallel evolution of sexual isolation in this species. Our findings represent a clear demonstration that host-plant adaptation can play a crucial and repeatable role in the early stages of speciation.},

The papers they synthesize provide readers with a broad understanding of the local and global aspects of settlement through traditional natural and social science lenses. This interdisciplinary vision gives the reader a comprehensive view of the urban ecosystem by introducing drivers, patterns, processes and effects of human settlements and the relationships between humans and other animals, plants, ecosystem processes, and abiotic conditions.

abstract = {Key Words sexual selection, cultural transmission, neurobiology, biomechanics ■ Abstract Bird song provides an unusually impressive illustration of vertebrate behavioral diversification. Research on bird song evolution traditionally focuses on factors that enhance song diversity, such as cultural transmission and sexual selection. Recent advances in the study of proximate mechanisms of vocal behavior, however, provide opportunities for studying mechanistic constraints on song evolution. The main goal of this review is to examine, from both conceptual and empirical perspectives, how proximate mechanisms might temper patterns of song evolution. We provide an overview of the two " substrates " of song evolution, memes and vocal mechanisms. We argue that properties of vocal mechanisms (control, production, and ontogeny) constrain vocal potential and may thus limit pathways of meme evolution. We then consider how vocal mechanisms may constrain song evolution under five scenarios of drift and selection and examine four specific song traits for which mechanistic con-straints appear to counter the diversifying effects of sexual selection. These examples illustrate the interplay between meme evolution as a diversifying influence and proxi-mate limitations as a barrier to song divergence. We conclude by suggesting that vocal mechanisms not only constrain song evolution but also can facilitate the evolution of novel vocal features.},

abstract = {Speciation in animals is almost always envisioned as the split of an existing lineage into an ancestral and a derived species. An alternative speciation route is homoploid hybrid speciation in which two ancestral taxa give rise to a third, derived, species by hybridization without a change in chromosome number. Although theoretically possible it has been regarded as rare and hence of little importance in animals. On the basis of molecular and chromosomal evidence, hybridization is the best explanation for the origin of a handful of extant diploid bisexual animal taxa. Here we report the first case in which hybridization between two host-specific animals (tephritid fruitflies) is clearly associated with the shift to a new resource. Such a hybrid host shift presents an ecologically robust scenario for animal hybrid speciation because it offers a potential mechanism for reproductive isolation through differential adaptation to a new ecological niche. The necessary conditions for this mechanism of speciation are common in parasitic animals, which represent much of animal diversity. The frequency of homoploid hybrid speciation in animals may therefore be higher than previously assumed.},

Water stress significantly decreased net photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate of both cultivars. It also decreased electron transport rate, effective quantum yield of Photosystem II, photochemical quenching, and starch content, but increased non-photochemical quenching and contents of total soluble sugars, proline, and malondialdehyde. However, the tetraploid cultivar showed higher resistance to water stress than the diploid, as indicated by the fact that gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and metabolites were less affected for the tetraploid than the diploid. Moreover, the tetraploid recovered more quickly than the diploid after re-watering. Morphological and anatomical analysis further revealed that the tetraploid possessed less whole plant leaf area, higher leaf mass per unit area, thicker epidermis (both upper and lower) and palisade tissue, as well as denser pubescence. All of those specialised structures caused by chromosome doubling might lead to greater capacity in coping with drought stress. Our findings suggest that the effect of chromosome doubling on drought resistance in L. japonica could attribute to the improvement of structure and photosynthesis-related traits.},

abstract = {A recent surge in attention devoted to the ecology of soil biota has prompted interest in quantifying similarities and differences between interactions occurring in above- and belowground communities. Furthermore, linkages that interconnect the dynamics of these two spatially distinct ecosystems are increasingly documented. We use a similar approach in the context of understanding plant defenses to herbivory, including how they are allocated between leaves and roots (constitutive defenses), and potential cross-system linkages (induced defenses). To explore these issues we utilized three different empirical approaches. First, we manipulated foliar and root herbivory on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and measured changes in the secondary chemistry of above- and belowground tissues. Second, we reviewed published studies that compared levels of secondary chemistry between leaves and roots to determine how plants distribute putative defense chemicals across the above- and belowground systems. Last, we used meta-analysis to quantify the impact of induced responses across plant tissue types. In the tobacco system, leaf-chewing insects strongly induced higher levels of secondary metabolites in leaves but had no impact on root chemistry. Nematode root herbivores, however, elicited changes in both leaves and roots. Virtually all secondary chemicals measured were elevated in nematode-induced galls, whereas the impact of root herbivory on foliar chemistry was highly variable and depended on where chemicals were produced within the plant. Importantly, nematodes interfered with aboveground metabolites that have biosynthetic sites located in roots (e.g., nicotine) but had the opposite effect (i.e., nematodes elevated foliar expression) on chemicals produced in shoots (e.g., phenolics and terpenoids). Results from our literature review suggest that, overall, constitutive defense levels are extremely similar when comparing leaves with roots, although certain chemical classes (e.g., alkaloids, glucosinolates) are differentially allocated between above- and belowground parts. Based on a meta-analysis of induced defense studies we conclude that: (1) foliar induction generates strong responses in leaves, but much weaker responses in roots, and (2) root induction elicits responses of equal magnitude in both leaves and roots. We discuss the importance of this asymmetry and the paradox of cross-system induction in relation to optimal defense theory and interactions between above- and belowground herbivory.},

abstract = {The heterogametic sex tends to be rare, absent, sterile, or deformed in F1 hybrid crosses between species, a pattern called Haldane's rule (HR). The introgression of single genes or chromosomal regions from one drosophilid species into the genetic background of another have shown that HR is most often associated with fixed genetic differences in inter-specific crosses. However, because such introgression studies have involved species diverged several hundred thousand generations from a common ancestor, it is not clear whether HR attends the speciation process or results from the accumulation of epistatically acting genes postspeciation. We report the first evidence for HR prior to speciation in crosses between two populations of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, collected 931 km apart in Colombia and Ecuador. In this cross, HR is manifested as an increase in the proportion of deformed males compared to females and the expression of HR is temperature dependent. Neither population, when crossed to a geographically distant population from Japan, exhibits HR at any rearing temperature. Using joint-scaling analysis and additional data from backcrosses and F2's, we find that the hybrid incompatibilities and the emergence of HR are concurrent processes involving interactions between X-linked and autosomal genes. However, we also find many examples of incompatibilities manifest by F2 and backcross hybrids but not by F1 hybrids and most incompatibilities are not sex different in their effects, even when they involve both X-autosomal interactions and genotype-by-environment interactions. We infer that incipient speciation in flour beetles can occur with or without HR and that significant hybrid incompatibilities result from the accumulation of epistatically acting gene differences between populations without differentially affecting the heterogametic sex in F1 hybrids. The temperature dependence of the incompatibilities supports the inference that genotype-by-environment interactions and adaptation to different environments contribute to the genetic divergence important to postzygotic reproductive isolation.},

While efforts to manage human-induced trait change are beginning to receive some attention, managing its ecological consequences has received virtually none. Recent work suggests that contemporary trait change can have important effects on the dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Therefore, trait changes caused by human activity may be shaping ecological dynamics on a global scale. We present evidence for important ecological effects associated with human-induced trait change in a variety of study systems. These effects can occur over large spatial scales and impact system-wide processes such as trophic cascades. Importantly, the magnitude of these effects can be on par with those of traditional ecological drivers such as species presence. However, phenotypic change is not always an agent of ecological change; it can also buffer ecosystems against change. Determining the conditions under which phenotypic change may promote vs prevent ecological change should be a top research priority.},

We measured phenotypic selection on floral traits of Lobelia siphilitica (Lobeliaceae) via female fitness to determine the relative strength of selection by pollinators and a specialist predispersal seed herbivore. We were able to attribute selection on flowering phenology to the herbivores. However, no selection could be attributed to pollinators, resulting in no conflicting selection on floral traits. Unlike pollinators, whose preference for certain floral traits does not always translate into higher fitness, any discrimination by seed herbivores is likely to decrease fitness of the preferred floral phenotype. Thus predispersal seed herbivores may be a significant agent of selection on floral traits.},

Ideally, DNA barcoding can provide a fast and reliable way to identify species. Compiling a library of barcodes can be enhanced by the numerous specimens available in botanic gardens, museums and her- baria and in other ex situ conservation collections. Barcoding can strengthen ongoing efforts of botanic gardens and ex situ conservation collections to preserve Earth's biodiversity. Our study aimed to detect the usability of the universal primers of the standard DNA barcode, to produce standard barcodes for species identification and to detect the discriminatory power of the standard barcode in a set of different groups of plant and fungal taxa. We studied Betula species originating from different parts of the world, and Salix taxa, bryophytes and edible and poisonous fungal species originating from Finland. In Betula and Salix, the standard DNA barcode regions, portions of matK and rbcL, were able to identify species to genus level, but did not show adequate resolution for species discrimination. Thus, sup- plementary barcode regions are needed for species identification. In Salix, the trnH-psbA spacer was also used, and it proved to have more resolution but, yet, not adequate levels of interspecific divergence for all studied taxa. In a set of bryophyte species, the rbcL gene region was found to possess adequate resolution for species discrimination for most genera studied. In bryophytes, matK failed to amplify properly. In fungi, the combination of ITS1 and ITS2 proved to be effective for species discrimination, although alignment difficulties were encountered. In general, closely related or recently diverged species are the greatest challenge, and the problem is most difficult in plants, both in terms of a suitable combi- nation of barcoding regions and the universality of used primers.},

abstract = {Ecological speciation is defined as the emergence of reproductive isolation as a direct or indirect consequence of divergent ecological adaptation. Several empirical examples of ecological speciation have been reported in the literature which very often involve adaptation to biotic resources. In this review, we investigate whether adaptation to different thermal habitats could also promote speciation and try to assess the importance of such processes in nature. Our survey of the literature identified 16 animal and plant systems where divergent thermal adaptation may underlie (partial) reproductive isolation between populations or may allow the stable coexistence of sibling taxa. In many of the systems, the differentially adapted populations have a parapatric distribution along an environmental gradient. Isolation often involves extrinsic selection against locally maladapted parental or hybrid genotypes, and additional pre- or postzygotic barriers may be important. Together, the identified examples strongly suggest that divergent selection between thermal environments is often strong enough to maintain a bimodal genotype distribution upon secondary contact. What is less clear from the available data is whether it can also be strong enough to allow ecological speciation in the face of gene flow through reinforcement-like processes. It is possible that intrinsic features of thermal gradients or the genetic basis of thermal adaptation make such reinforcement-like processes unlikely but it is equally possible that pertinent systems are understudied. Overall, our literature survey highlights (once again) the dearth of studies that investigate similar incipient species along the continuum from initial divergence to full reproductive isolation and studies that investigate all possible reproductive barriers in a given system.},

The differences found are not attributable to large climatic differences, but to factors acting on a local scale. Ac and Li are not independently assorted: six out of sixteen populations studied showed a positive linkage disequilibrium. As Ac and Li are not genetically linked, the association must be the result of epistatic selection favouring Ac-Li-phenotypes. The relative importance of deterministic forces, i.e. natural selection, and stochastic ones (founder effects, drift) in determining the phenotypic frequencies found in The Netherlands are discussed.},

abstract = {Species distribution models are usually evaluated with cross-validation. In this procedure evaluation statistics are computed from model predictions for sites of presence and absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and MaxEnt), I show that this procedure is highly sensitive to "spatial sorting bias": the difference between the geographic distance from testing-presence to training-presence sites and the geographic distance from testing-absence (or testing-background) to training-presence sites. I propose the use of pairwise distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null model that only considers the geographic distance to training sites to calibrate cross-validation results for remaining bias. Model evaluation results (AUC) were strongly inflated: the null model performed better than MaxEnt for 45{\%} and better than Bioclim for 67{\%} of the species. Spatial sorting bias and area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) values increased when using partitioned presence data and random-absence data instead of independently obtained presence-absence testing data from systematic surveys. Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias, yielding null models with an AUC close to 0.5, such that AUC was the same as null model calibrated AUC (cAUC). This adjustment strongly decreased AUC values and changed the ranking among species. Cross-validation results for different species are only comparable after removal of spatial sorting bias and/or calibration with an appropriate null model.},

High spatial variation in selection should lead to differentiation of floral traits among populations. In contrast, high temporal variation in selection should retard the evolution of population-specific floral phenotypes. To determine the relative importance of spatial vs. temporal variation in natural selection, we measured phenotypic selection on seven floral traits of the wildflowers Lobelia cardinalis and L. siphilitica in 1999 and 2000. Lobelia cardinalis experienced significant temporal variation in selection. whereas L. siphilitica experienced spatial variation in selection on the same traits. This variation in selection on floral traits was associated with spatial and temporal differences in the soil microenvironment. Although few studies of natural selection include spatial or temporal replicates, our results suggest that such replication is critical for understanding the distribution of phenotypes in nature.},

We present a model of two-locus incompatibilities that distinguishes among three types of hybrid interactions: those between heterozygous loci (H(0)), those between a heterozygous and a homozygous (or hemizygous) locus (H(1)), and those between homozygous loci (H(2)). We predict the relative fitnesses of hybrid genotypes by calculating the expected numbers of each type of incompatibility. We use this model to study Haldane's rule and the large effect of X chromosomes on postzygotic isolation. We show that the severity of H(0) vs. H(1) incompatibilities is key to understanding Haldane's rule, while the severity of H(1) vs. H(2) incompatibilities must also be considered to explain large X effects. Large X effects are not inevitable in backcross analyses but rather-like Haldane's rule-may often reflect the recessivity of alleles causing postzygotic isolation. We also consider incompatibilities involving the Y (or W) chromosome and maternal effects. Such incompatibilities are common in Drosophila species crosses, and their consequences in male- vs. female-heterogametic taxa may explain the pattern of exceptions to Haldane's rule.},

abstract = {The benefits of ant-plant-herbivore interactions for the plant depend on the abundance of ants and herbivores and the selective pressures these arthropods exert. In plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFN), different mean trait values may be selected for by different populations in response to local herbivore pressure, ultimately resulting in the evolution of differences in plant traits that attract ants as defensive agents against herbivory. To determine if variation in traits that mediate ant-plant interactions reflect herbivore selective pressures, we quantified intra- and inter-population variation in plant traits for eight populations of the EFN-bearing annual Chamaecrista fasciculata (Michx.) (Fabaceae). Censuses in rural and urban areas of Missouri and Illinois (USA) showed population differences in ant attendance and herbivore pressure. Seeds were collected from each population, and plants were grown in a common greenhouse environment to measure sugar production, nectar volume and composition, EFN size and time of emergence, leaf pubescence, and leaf quality throughout plant development. Populations varied mainly in terms of nectary size, sugar production, and nectar volume, but to a lesser degree in leaf pubescence. Populations of C. fasciculata within urban areas (low in insect abundance) had small nectaries and the lowest nectar production. There was a positive correlation across populations between herbivore density and leaf damage by those herbivores on the one hand and sugar production and nectar volume on the other. These results, in conjunction with lack of evidence for maternally based environmental effects, suggest that population differences in herbivore damage have promoted differential evolution of EFN-related traits among populations.},

We previously described the evolution of a novel trait, aerobic citrate utilization (Cit(+)), in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Here we analyse genome sequences to investigate the history and genetic basis of this trait. At least three distinct clades coexisted for more than 10,000 generations before its emergence. The Cit(+) trait originated in one clade by a tandem duplication that captured an aerobically expressed promoter for the expression of a previously silent citrate transporter. The clades varied in their propensity to evolve this novel trait, although genotypes able to do so existed in all three clades, implying that multiple potentiating mutations arose during the population's history. Our findings illustrate the importance of promoter capture and altered gene regulation in mediating the exaptation events that often underlie evolutionary innovations.},

Native species are replaced with widespread non- native species and ants are among the world's most notorious invaders. To date, all documented cases of ant invasions involve exotic introduced species that are spread around the world by human-mediated dispersal. I investigated the effect of urbanization on the evolution of invasive characteristics in a native ant species, the odorous house ant, Tapinoma sessile (Say). Colony social structure, life history traits, and the spatial pattern of nest distribution were compared by sampling T. sessile across a gradient of three distinct habitats: natural, semi-natural, and urban. Results demonstrate a remarkable transition in colony social and spatial structure and life history traits between natural and urban environments. In natural habitats, T. sessile colonies are comprised of small, monogyne (single queen), and monodomous (single nest) colonies. In urban areas, T. sessile often exhibit extreme polygyny and polydomy, form large super- colonies, and become a dominant pest. Results also suggest that urban T. sessile colonies may have a negative impact on native ant abundance and diver- sity. In the natural environment T. sessile coexisted with a wide array of other ant species, while very few G.

The inclusion of elevation range increased the predictive accuracy ofclimate-only models for 86 of the 100 species. The differences in projected futuredistributions were most notable in mountainous areas, where the climate–topographymodels projected only ca. half of the species losses than the climate-only models. Bycontrast, climate–topography models estimated double the losses of species than climateonlymodels in the flatlands regions. Our findings suggest that disregarding topographicalheterogeneity may cause a significant source of error in broad-scale bioclimaticmodelling. Mountainous regions are likely to be even more important for futureconservation of species than had until now been predicted, based on bioclimaticenvelope models that did not take an explicit account of elevational range of gridsquares.},

Such ecological mating cues are now considered more common than previously thought, but we still know little about the genetic changes underlying their evolution, or more generally about the genetic basis for assortative mating behaviors. The warning patterns of Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno are under disruptive selection due to increased predation of non-mimetic hybrids, and are used during mate recognition. We carried out a genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of preference behaviors between these species and showed that divergent male preference has a simple genetic basis. Three QTLs each explain a large proportion of the differences in preference behavior observed between the parental species. Two of these QTLs are on chromosomes with major color pattern genes, including one that is tightly associated with the gene optix. Different loci influence different aspects of attraction, suggesting that behavioral isolation in Heliconius involves the evolution of independently segregating modules, similar to those for the corresponding wing pattern cues. Hybridization and subsequent sharing of wing pattern loci has played an important role during adaptation and speciation in Heliconius butterflies. The existence of large effect preference loci could similarly assist the evolution of novel behavioral phenotypes through recombination and introgression, and should facilitate rapid speciation.},

abstract = {Models of population divergence and speciation are often based on the assumption that differences between populations are due to genetic factors, and that phenotypic change is due to natural selection. It is equally plausible that some of the differences among populations are due to phenotypic plasticity. We use the metaphor of the adaptive landscape to review the role of phenotypic plasticity in driving genetic evolution. Moderate levels of phenotypic plasticity are optimal in permitting population survival in a new environment and in bringing populations into the realm of attraction of an adaptive peak. High levels of plasticity may increase the probability of population persistence but reduce the likelihood of genetic change, because the plastic response itself places the population close to a peak. Moderate levels of plasticity arise whenever multiple traits, some of which are plastic and others not, form a composite trait involved in the adaptive response. For example, altered behaviours may drive selection on morphology and physiology. Because there is likely to be a considerable element of chance in which behaviours become established, behavioural change followed by morphological and physiological evolution may be a potent force in driving evolution in novel directions. We assess the role of phenotypic plasticity in stimulating evolution by considering two examples from birds: (i) the evolution of red and yellow plumage coloration due to carotenoid consumption; and (ii) the evolution of foraging behaviours on islands. Phenotypic plasticity is widespread in nature and may speed up, slow down, or have little effect on evolutionary change. Moderate levels of plasticity may often facilitate genetic evolution but careful analyses of individual cases are needed to ascertain whether plasticity has been essential or merely incidental to population differentiation.},

Laboratory colonies established from a Missouri population (37.degree.N lat.) with a high cannibalism rate and a Mexican population (19.degree.N lat.) with a low cannibalism rate were used to examine the genetic basis of cannibalism by means of a controlled breeding design. When larvae were held in pairs on artificial diet in 30 ml plastic cups at 30.degree.C 16L:8D, the highest incidence of cannibalism in both Missouri and Mexican populations was found in larvae 15 to 18 days-of-age (5th and 6th instars). Under these conditions, cannibalism was expressed in 33{\%} of the pairs formed from Missouri larvae and 11{\%} of the pairs formed from Mexican larvae. First and second generation crosses between Missouri and Mexican populations showed an intermediate level of cannibalism, whereas backcrosses to the parental generations showed a regression to the parental phenotypes. These results indicate that cannibalism is under additive genetic control. Larvae from the Missouri parental population were more likely to consume their victim (i.e., cannibalize) once intraspecific kiling had occurred than were larvae from the Mexican parental population or from any of the crosses, and female larvae were cannibals more often than were males. Under the conditions employed, no advantage was detected for cannibalism over intraspecific killing for larval weight gain or growth rate.},

Here, we estimated multiple components of RI between two Mediterranean orchid sister species (Orchis mascula and Orchis pauciflora), disentangling the strength and absolute contributions of seven different isolating mechanisms. Our survey includes one prepollination, two postpollination prezygotic (pollen-stigma incompatibility, conspecific pollen precedence), two intrinsic postzygotic (embryo mortality and hybrid sterility) and two extrinsic postzygotic (hybrid habitat differentiation and hybrid pollination) isolating mechanisms. We found strong RI between the investigated species, although none of the barriers were able to completely impede gene flow. Five isolating mechanisms contributed positively to the maintenance of species boundaries. Contrary to most surveys of isolating mechanisms, our data speak against a clear predominance of prepollination or of prezygotic barriers but confirm the emerging pattern of multiple barriers contributing to the maintenance of species integrity. These findings suggest an allopatric condition during early phases of species divergence. We discuss our data in the wider context of previous studies carried out in this orchid group by using a comparative approach.},

Since the mid-dle of the last century, ecological opportunity has been invoked as a potential key to understanding when and how adaptive radiation occurs. Interest in the topic of ecological opportunity has accelerated as research on adaptive radiation has experienced a resurgence, fueled in part by advances in phy-logenetic approaches to studying evolutionary diversification. Nonetheless, what the term actually means, much less how it mechanistically leads to adaptive diversification, is currently debated; whether the term has any pre-dictive value or is a heuristic useful only for post hoc explanation also remains unclear. Recent recognition that evolutionary change can occur rapidly and on a timescale commensurate with ecological processes suggests that it is time to synthesize ecological and evolutionary approaches to the study of community assembly and evolutionary diversification.},

abstract = {Samples of mature plants of Lotus corniculatus collected in natural habitats in western Europe show that the polymorphism for cyanogenesis in this species is not directly comparable with that in Trifolium repens. There is, however, a decline in the frequency of the cyanogenic form from the Netherlands to Scandinavia. It is argued that T. Tepees is not a satisfactory plant for studies of localised variation because of its widespread use in agriculture. Cyanogenic cultivated varieties of L. corniculatus are now regular contaminants of the grass seed sown on the edges of many new roads and consequently care must also be exercised when working with this species. Because L. corniculatus reproduces vegetatively the criteria used for sampling and estimating phenotype fre- quencies are discussed in detail. Some plants have the ability to change pheno- type during the year and the problems this poses for population studies are explained. Because there is no single explanation for the many examples of localised variation in the frequency of cyanogenic L. corniculatus it is argued that there is little purpose in continuing work whose principal objective is an overall hypothesis.},

abstract = {Subtle differences in the pattern of arrangement of types of vertebrae and associated median skeletal structures between a benthic and limnetic species pair of three-spine stickleback from Paxton Lake, British Columbia, are typical of those found throughout the range of the Gasterosteus aculeatus species complex. We established laboratory colonies from just three individuals of each species, and studied the effect of three generations of inbreeding on axial morphology. There was sufficient divergence in the location of individual elements between families to regenerate close to the entire range of axial diversity seen in threespine sticklebacks worldwide. Analysis of the patterns of variance and covariance between the axial locations of elements provides evidence for the action of both meristic and homeotic processes in the generation of morphological divergence within each species. Hybrid sticklebacks produced by the cross of limnetic and benthic parents tend to have intermediate morphologies, with dominance of either parental type evident for some elements. Effects of temperature and salinity were found to be small in direct comparison with between-family effects, and varied according to genetic background. These results demonstrate that considerable genetic variation for axial morphology is maintained in natural populations of three-spine stickleback, and that differences between populations may be brought about rapidly by changes in frequency of alleles that have coordinated effects along the body axis.},

In the latter case, we emphasize the importance of contingency and ecological and genomic context in outcomes of hybridization.

abstract = {Human activities can alter selective environments in ways that can reduce the usefulness of certain ornamental traits as honest signals of individual quality and, in some cases, may create evolutionary traps, where rapid changes in selective environments result in maladaptive behavioral decisions. Using the sexually dichromatic, socially monogamous Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) as a model, we hypothesized that urbanization would erode the relationship between plumage coloration and reproductive success. Because the exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) provides carotenoids, is a preferred habitat attribute, and increases vulnerability to nest predation, we predicted the presence of an evolutionary trap, whereby the brightest males would achieve the lowest reproductive success. Working at 14 forests in Ohio, USA, 2006-2008, we measured plumage color, monitored reproduction, and quantified habitat within territories. In rural landscapes, the brightest males bred earliest in the season and secured more preferred territories; however, annual reproduction declined with plumage brightness. Coloration of urban males was not associated with territory attributes or reproduction. Female redness across all landscapes was negatively related to reproduction. Poor reproductive performance of otherwise higher-quality males probably resulted from preferences for honeysuckle, which reduces annual reproduction when used as a nesting substrate early in the season. In this way, exotic shrubs prompted an evolutionary trap that was avoided in urban forests where anthropogenic resources disassociated male color and reproductive phenology and success. Our study illustrates how modified selective environments in human-dominated landscapes might shape microevolutionary processes in wild bird populations.},

abstract = {Adaptive differentiation between populations is often proposed to be the product of multiple interacting selective pressures, although empirical support for this is scarce. In white clover, populations show adaptive differentiation in frequencies of cyanogenesis, the ability to produce hydrogen cyanide after tissue damage. This polymorphism arises through independently segregating polymorphisms for the presence/absence of two required cyanogenic components, cyanogenic glucosides and their hydrolysing enzyme. White clover populations worldwide have evolved a series of recurrent, climate-associated clines, with higher frequencies of cyanogenic plants in warmer locations. These clines have traditionally been hypothesized to reflect a fitness trade-off between chemical defence in herbivore-rich areas (warmer climates) and energetic costs of producing cyanogenic components in areas of low herbivore pressure (cooler climates). Recent observational studies suggest that cyanogenic components may also be beneficial in water-stressed environments. We investigated fitness trade-offs associated with temperature-induced water stress in the cyanogenesis system using manipulative experiments in growth chambers and population surveys across a longitudinal precipitation gradient in the central United States. We find that plants producing cyanogenic glucosides have higher relative fitness in treatments simulating a moderate, persistent drought stress. In water-neutral treatments, there are energetic costs to producing cyanogenic components, but only in treatments with nutrient stress. These fitness trade-offs are consistent with cyanogenesis frequencies in natural populations, where we find clinal variation in the proportion of plants producing cyanogenic glucosides along the precipitation gradient. These results suggest that multiple selective pressures interact to maintain this adaptive polymorphism and that modelling adaptation will require knowledge of environment-specific fitness effects.},

In this study, we examine brown rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) to test hypotheses about the repeatability of neutral evolution across four cities: Salvador, Brazil; New Orleans, USA; Vancouver, Canada; and New York City, USA. At least 150 rats were sampled from each city and genotyped for a minimum of 15 000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms. Levels of genome-wide diversity were similar across cities, but varied across neighbourhoods within cities. All four populations exhibited high spatial autocorrelation at the shortest distance classes (less than 500 m) owing to limited dispersal. Coancestry and evolutionary clustering analyses identified genetic discontinuities within each city that coincided with a resource desert in New York City, major waterways in New Orleans, and roads in Salvador and Vancouver. Such replicated studies are crucial to assessing the generality of predictions from urban evolution, and have practical applications for pest management and public health. Future studies should include a range of global cities in different biomes, incorporate multiple species, and examine the impact of specific characteristics of the built environment and human socioeconomics on gene flow.},

However, part of this variation is heritable and selection analyses show that biotic interactions can modulate selection on flowering phenology. Our review of the literature indicates that pollinators tend to favour peak or earlier flowering, whereas pre-dispersal seed predators tend to favour off-peak or later flowering. However, effects strongly vary among study systems. To understand such variation, future studies should address the impact of mutualist and antagonist dispersal ability, ecological specialization, and habitat and plant population characteristics, Here, we outline future directions to study how such interactions shape flowering phenology},

Here, we investigated population and sex differences in timing of maturation within and between two nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) populations in a laboratory breeding experiment. We found that fish from the high-predation marine population matured earlier than fish from the low-predation pond population and males matured earlier than females. Timing of maturation in both reciprocal hybrid crosses between the two populations was similar to that in the marine population, suggesting that early timing of maturation is a dominant trait, whereas delayed timing of maturation in the pond is a recessive trait. Thus, the observed population divergence is suggestive of strong natural selection against early maturation in the piscine-predator-free pond population.},

Here, we quantify the contribution of pollinator diversity and foraging behaviour to assortative pollen deposition in three mixed-ploidy populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae). Diploids and tetraploids were not differentiated with respect to composition of insect visitors. However, foraging patterns of the three most common insect visitors (all bees) reinforced assortative pollination. Bees visited tetraploids disproportionately often and exhibited higher constancy on tetraploids in all three populations. In total, 73{\%} of all bee flights were between flowers of the same ploidy (2x-2x, 4x-4x); 58{\%} of all flights to diploids and 83{\%} to tetraploids originated from diploid and tetraploid plants, respectively. Patterns of pollen deposition on stigmas mirrored pollinator foraging behaviour; 73{\%} of all pollen on stigmas (70 and 75{\%} of pollen on diploid and tetraploid stigmas, respectively) came from within-ploidy pollinations. These results indicate that pollinators contribute to high rates of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation. If patterns of fertilization track pollen deposition, pollinator-plant interactions may help explain the persistence and spread of tetraploids in mixed-ploidy populations.},

abstract = {Aim Climate change causes shifts in species distributions, or 'migrations'. Despite the centrality of species distributions to biodiversity conservation, the demonstrated large migration of tropical plant species in response to climate change in the past, and the expected sensitivity of species distributions to modern climate change, no study has tested for modern species migrations in tropical plants. Here we conduct a first test of the hypothesis that increasing temperatures are causing tropical trees to migrate to cooler areas. Location Tropical Andes biodiversity hotspot, south-eastern Peru, South America. Methods We use data from repeated (2003/04-2007/08) censuses of 14 1-ha forest inventory plots spanning an elevational gradient from 950 to 3400 m in Manu National Park in south-eastern Peru, to characterize changes in the elevational distributions of 38 Andean tree genera. We also analyse changes in the genus-level composition of the inventory plots through time. Results We show that most tropical Andean tree genera shifted their mean distributions upslope over the study period and that the mean rate of migration is approximately 2.5-3.5 vertical metres upslope per year. Consistent with upward migrations we also find increasing abundances of tree genera previously distributed at lower elevations in the majority of study plots. Main conclusions These findings are in accord with the a priori hypothesis of upward shifts in species ranges due to elevated temperatures, and are potentially the first documented evidence of present-day climate-driven migrations in a tropical plant community. The observed mean rate of change is less than predicted from the temperature increases for the region, possibly due to the influence of changes in moisture or non-climatic factors such as substrate, species interactions, lags in tree community response and/or dispersal limitations. Whatever the cause(s), continued slower-than-expected migration of tropical Andean trees would indicate a limited ability to respond to increased temperatures, which may lead to increased extinction risks with further climate change.},

abstract = {Induced responses to herbivores are common and well documented in plants. It has been hypothesized that the evolutionary ecology of induced responses can be understood by studying benefits of induction in the presence of herbivores and costs of induction in the absence of herbivores. Phenotypic benefits and costs of induction would indicate that such plasticity in defense could be adaptive (i.e., that phenotypes matched to their environmental conditions have higher relative fitness than unmatched phenotypes). However, few studies to date have investigated the benefits and costs of induction in the same system. In this study, induced responses of Lepidium virginicum to herbivory reduced feeding by generalist noctuid caterpillars in choice and no-choice experiments. Induced plant responses to herbivory were correlated with an increase in the number of trichomes per leaf and an increase in the diversity of the putatively defensive chemical compounds, glucosinolates, present in the foliage of damaged plants compared to undamaged controls. Induction did not affect the feeding behavior of the larvae of the specialist butterfly, Pieris rapae. In field experiments, induction reduced natural colonization of plants by aphids compared to both unmanipulated controls and controls that were damaged (but not induced) by clipping a leaf from the plant using a pair of scissors. Induced plants were more likely to survive in the field than clipped plants, a result that suggests a net fitness benefit of induction when leaf tissue removal was controlled. In experiments conducted in the absence of herbivores, damage induced responses did not reduce the root or shoot biomass of plants grown at low density. At high plant density, induction was associated with both reduced root biomass and increased aboveground growth, suggesting that induction may cause an allocation shift, rather than a loss of total biomass. Induced responses of plants satisfy a necessary component of adaptive plasticity because plants in variable herbivore environments maximize relative fitness by adjusting their defensive phenotype.},

abstract = {Speciation, the process by which two species form from one, involves the development of reproductive isolation of two divergent lineages. Here, we report the establishment and persistence of a reproductively isolated population of Darwin's finches on the small Gal{\'{a}}pagos Island of Daphne Major in the secondary contact phase of speciation. In 1981, an immigrant medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) arrived on the island. It was unusually large, especially in beak width, sang an unusual song, and carried some Geospiza scandens alleles. We followed the fate of this individual and its descendants for seven generations over a period of 28 years. In the fourth generation, after a severe drought, the lineage was reduced to a single brother and sister, who bred with each other. From then on this lineage, inheriting unusual song, morphology, and a uniquely homozygous marker allele, was reproductively isolated, because their own descendants bred with each other and with no other member of the resident G. fortis population. These observations agree with some expectations of an ecological theory of speciation in that a barrier to interbreeding arises as a correlated effect of adaptive divergence in morphology. However, the important, culturally transmitted, song component of the barrier appears to have arisen by chance through an initial imperfect copying of local song by the immigrant. The study reveals additional stochastic elements of speciation, in which divergence is initiated in allopatry; immigration to a new area of a single male hybrid and initial breeding with a rare hybrid female.},

abstract = {Cyanogenesis, the production of hydrocyanic acid, is a trait in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) controlled by alleles at two unlinked loci, Ac and Li. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the proportion of cyanogenic plants in the accessions of the U.S. white clover germplasm collection, (ii) to determine how representative the core subset was of the entire collection for cyanogenesis, and (iii) to determine the relationship of cyanogenesis, in accessions collected in situ, to collection site and climate. Twenty plants from each of 548 white clover accessions were grown in the greenhouse from 1991 to 1993. Two to three leaves per plant were harvested and the presence or absence of hydrocyanic acid was determined by the picric acid test. The U.S. germplasm collection was predominantly acyanogenic with a third of the plants evaluated being cyanogenic. Accessions with the most cyanogenic plants were collected in Morocco, Spain, Portugal, France, and Turkey while the least cyanogenic plants were collected in China, Romania, Russia, Kazakhstan, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Slovenia. Accessions collected in Morocco, Portugal, and Spain had the greatest intensity of cyanogenic reaction. Geographic stratification with random sampling was an effective method of developing a core subset, as the white clover core subset was representative of the entire collection for total cyanogenesis and distribution of cyanogenic plants. Cyanogenic frequency was greater in accessions collected at low altitudes and at sites with high winter temperatures, lower summer precipitation, greater spring cloudiness ({\%} sunshine), and less snow cover. Latitude of collection was not associated with cyanogenic frequency in white clover.},

abstract = {Biological invasions are 'natural' experiments that can improve our understanding of contemporary evolution. We evaluate evidence for population differentiation, natural selection and adaptive evolution of invading plants and animals at two nested spatial scales: (i) among introduced populations (ii) between native and introduced genotypes. Evolution during invasion is frequently inferred, but rarely confirmed as adaptive. In common garden studies, quantitative trait differentiation is only marginally lower ({\~{}}3.5{\%}) among introduced relative to native populations, despite genetic bottlenecks and shorter timescales (i.e. millennia vs. decades). However, differentiation between genotypes from the native vs. introduced range is less clear and confounded by nonrandom geographic sampling; simulations suggest this causes a high false-positive discovery rate ({\textgreater}50{\%}) in geographically structured populations. Selection differentials (¦s¦) are stronger in introduced than in native species, although selection gradients (¦$\beta$¦) are not, consistent with introduced species experiencing weaker genetic constraints. This could facilitate rapid adaptation, but evidence is limited. For example, rapid phenotypic evolution often manifests as geographical clines, but simulations demonstrate that nonadaptive trait clines can evolve frequently during colonization ({\~{}}two-thirds of simulations). Additionally, QST -FST studies may often misrepresent the strength and form of natural selection acting during invasion. Instead, classic approaches in evolutionary ecology (e.g. selection analysis, reciprocal transplant, artificial selection) are necessary to determine the frequency of adaptive evolution during invasion and its influence on establishment, spread and impact of invasive species. These studies are rare but crucial for managing biological invasions in the context of global change.},

abstract = {It is remarkable that, although plant breeding sys- tems have been an active area of research for over a century, no comprehensive treatment has been at- tempted since Darwin's two volumes on the subject. Prior to the 1960's, information on plant reproductive systems gradually accumulated as a by-product of work in early Mendelian genetics, experimental taxonomy, and crop improvement. During the past 25 years, how- ever, the study of breeding systems has expanded and diversified so that today, studies in this area are central to many important contemporary issues in plant evo- lutionary biology. The broadening of interest in plant breeding systems has largely resulted from three de- velopments in population biology: 1) the application of electrophoretic procedures for measuring mating- system parameters such as selfing rates, gene flow, and male fertility; 2) the development oftheoretical models concerned with the evolution and maintenance ofvar- ious breeding systems such as gynodioecy, heterostyly, and selfing; and 3) associated with the growth of evo- lutionary ecology, an increase in experimental field studies in which the breeding system is viewed not in isolation but within the context of demography, sexual selection, and life-history evolution. The recent em- phasis on theory and experimentation and the move away from Darlingtonian group selectionist explana- tions to account for the evolution of breeding systems are attributable to the influence of population geneti- cists and several prominent animal ecologists. While many plant biologists have been reluctant to accept concepts borrowed from the animal literature (bota- nists, after all, are a conservative lot who value tra- dition), there is no doubt that the study of plant breed- ing systems can no longer proceed in a theoretical vacuum and that our thinking about the way plants mate has been dramatically influenced by the realiza- tion that most plants, although hermaphroditic, are unlikely to transmit genes equally via pollen and ovules.},

The first is the matrix of nonlinear selection gradients (gamma) which describes the individual fitness surface. The second is the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) that influences the multivariate response to selection. A common approach to the empirical analysis of these matrices is the element-by-element testing of significance, and subsequent biological interpretation of pattern based on these univariate and bivariate parameters. Here, I show why this approach is likely to misrepresent the genetic basis of quantitative traits, and the selection acting on them in many cases. Diagonalization of square matrices is a fundamental aspect of many of the multivariate statistical techniques used by biologists. Applying this, and other related approaches, to the analysis of the structure of gamma and G matrices, gives greater insight into the form and strength of nonlinear selection, and the availability of genetic variance for multiple traits.},

For this study, floral characters and pollinator attraction were measured for the two species, F1 hybrids, and backcrosses. Floral dimensions, nectar characters, and color spectra combined in the hybrids in a largely linear fashion, consistent with an interpretation of net additive gene expression. In other words, the changes from one pollination syndrome to another appeared to be quantitative. There were some deviations from linearity, but not so much as to obscure the linear effect. Generally, backcrosses were not more variable than F1 hybrids or pure parents. Hummingbirds preferred P. centranthifolius over P. spectabilis. The strength of this preference varied by year, and the birds did not respond to hybrids in a strictly linear fashion. When there was a preference, adding nectar hourly to under-visited plants quickly changed the foraging of hummingbirds. Bees in the genus Ceratina preferred the bee-pollination syndrome of P. spectabilis.},

Although this type of isolating mechanism has received considerable attention, we have few examples describing how genetic incompatibilities evolve. We investigated the evolution of two loci involved in a classic example of a Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibility in Xiphophorus, a genus of freshwater fishes from northern Central America. Hybrids develop a lethal melanoma due to the interaction of two loci, an oncogene and its repressor. We cloned and sequenced the putative repressor locus in 25 Xiphophorus species and an outgroup species, and determined the status of the oncogene in those species from the literature. Using phylogenetic analyses, we find evidence that a repeat region in the proximal promoter of the repressor is coevolving with the oncogene. The data support a hypothesis that departs from the standard BDM model: it appears the alleles that cause the incompatibilities have coevolved simultaneously within lineages, rather than in allopatric or temporal isolation.},

abstract = {Plants possess two types of resistance against herbivores: ever-present constitutive resistance and induced resistance triggered by attack. As the production of both resistance types entails a metabolic cost, a tradeoff between them has frequently been hypothesized. Over twenty published studies have tested for the existence of this tradeoff, but this literature is marred by three methodological problems. The first problem is lack of agreement about how to measure induced resistance, a complex trait that typically involves comparison between damaged and undamaged plants. Some metrics of induced resistance confound constitutive and induced resistance, creating evidence for a tradeoff when one does not exist or obscuring real tradeoffs. On both biological and statistical grounds, we argue for the difference in mean resistance between damaged and control plants from the same family or genotype as the best metric of induced resistance. The second problem is that limited sampling (e.g. of families or of individuals within families) or errors in measuring resistance traits of individuals can generate spurious evidence for a tradeoff even when our preferred induced resistance metric is used. The third problem is that some families may show induced susceptibility (lower resistance in damaged than in undamaged plants). To provide a better test for a tradeoff, we devise a Monte Carlo procedure that accounts for sampling variation, measurement error and induced susceptibility without producing unrealistic negative resistance values, and we illustrate it with simulated data. Until the problems we describe are widely addressed and the tools we propose are widely applied, the resistance tradeoff hypothesis cannot be considered to have been adequately evaluated. Our approach also applies whenever the plasticity of a trait (measured as the difference between treatments or environments) is compared to the value of that trait in a single environment.},

Morphology of first-generation genetic hybrids can provide an understanding of population differences and evolution that may otherwise be difficult to obtain. This study compares postcranial morphology in two hybrids of saddle-back tamarins (S. f. illigeri x S. f. lagonotus and S. f. illigeri x S. f. leucogenys) to the purebred subspecies. We examine whether postcranial morphology differs between the purebred subspecies and their hybrids, and whether hybrids exhibit heterosis indicative of genetic differences between the parental subspecies. Fifty postcranial dimensions, or traits, were measured on 287 S. fuscicollis skeletons. Measurements were corrected for sex differences and environmental differences (wild-derived or laboratory-born). Females were larger than males for most postcranial dimensions, especially in the pelvis. Significant environmental differences were found throughout the postcranial skeleton, with wild-derived animals generally larger than animals born in the laboratory. Significant heterosis was found for six postcranial traits in the S. f. illigeri x S. f. leucogenys cross, and heterosis was found for 15 postcranial traits in the S. f. illigeri x S. f. lagonotus cross. These results suggest that subspecies differences in skeletal morphology are generally due to genetic rather than environmental differences. The subspecies appear to represent geographic isolates that differ in gene frequencies and directional dominance for skeletal traits.},

The validity of this hypothesis is a key question in ecology in that it proposes a mechanism for commonness and rarity, and if true, may help predict species' vulnerability to extinction. We identified 64 studies that measured niche breadth and range size, and we used a meta-analytic approach to test for the presence of a niche breadth-range size relationship. We found a significant positive relationship between range size and environmental tolerance breadth (z = 0.49), habitat breadth (z = 0.45), and diet breadth (z = 0.28). The overall positive effect persisted even when incorporating sampling effects. Despite significant variability in the strength of the relationship among studies, the general positive relationship suggests that specialist species might be disproportionately vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change due to synergistic effects of a narrow niche and small range size. An understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that drive and cause deviations from this niche breadth-range size pattern is an important future research goal.},

Ecological characteristics of the striped field mouse prevent decreases in genetic variability within local urban populations. High population density, ability to cross environmental barriers and to use ‘‘green corridors'' allows this species to maintain gene flow in fragmented urban landscape. However, genetic variability and gene flow were efficiently reduced in the central part of the city. The results indicated that the degree of human pressure, defined based on the level of vegetation cover, is a good indicator of isolation. In the studied striped field mouse population, genetic interactions among particular locations (local populations) are modified in comparison with pop- ulations inhabiting natural areas, by replacement of the isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation with the ‘‘isolation-by-infrastructure'' pattern. As indicated by Bayesian analysis, the urban population from the right side of the Vistula river form common genetic cluster with ex- urban population located northward from the city, while the population from the left side of the river probably exchanges genes with neighbouring northern and southern ex-urban populations. However local populations at loca- tions within the highest zone of anthropopressure are clearly isolated, and presently constitute separate genetic units.},

For 15 population pairs we created a full spectrum of line crosses (two parental, two reciprocal F1's, four F2's, and eight backcrosses), reared them at multiple temperatures, and analyzed the numbers and developmental defects of offspring. We assayed a total of 219,388 offspring from 5147 families. Failed crosses occurred predominately in F2's, giving evidence of F2 breakdown within this species. In all cases where a significant model could be fit to the data on offspring number, we observed at least one type of digenic epistasis. We also found maternal and cytoplasmic effects to be common components of divergence among T. castaneum populations. In some cases, the most complex model tested (additive, dominance, epistatic, maternal, and cytoplasmic effects) did not provide a significant fit to the data, suggesting that linkage or higher order epistasis is involved in differentiation between some populations. For the limb deformity data, we observed significant genotype-by-environment interaction in most crosses and pure parent crosses tended to have fewer deformities than hybrid crosses. Complexity of genetic architecture was not correlated with either geographic distance or genetic distance. Our results support the view that genetic incompatibilities responsible for postzygotic isolation, an important component of speciation, may be a natural but serendipitous consequence of nonadditive genetic effects and structured populations.},

abstract = {Hybridization is an important evolutionary mechanism that can increase the fitness and adaptive potential of populations. A growing body of evidence supports its importance as a key factor contributing to rapid evolution in invasive species, but the effects of hybridization have rarely been assessed in intentionally introduced biological control agents. We investigated hybrids between a Swiss and an Italian population of the beetle, Longitarsus jacobaeae, a biological control agent of Jacobaea vulgaris, by reciprocally crossing individuals in the laboratory. Phenological traits of F1 and F2 hybrid lineages showed intermediate values relative to their parental populations, with some maternal influence. Fitness of the F2 generation, measured as lifetime fecundity, was higher than that of the Italian parent in one of the lineages and higher than that of either parent in the other hybrid lineage. The increased fecundity of hybrids may benefit tansy ragwort biological control by increasing the establishment success and facilitating a more rapid population buildup in the early generations.

abstract = {Evolutionary ecologists aim to explain and predict evolutionary change under different selective regimes. Theory suggests that such evolutionary prediction should be more difficult for biomechanical systems in which different trait combinations generate the same functional output: ―many-to-one mapping‖. Many-to-one mapping of phenotype to function enables multiple morphological solutions to meet the same adaptive challenges. Therefore, many-to-one mapping should undermine parallel morphological evolution, and hence evolutionary predictability, even when selection pressures are shared among populations. Studying 16 replicate pairs of lake- and stream-adapted threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), we quantified three parts of the teleost feeding apparatus and used biomechanical models to calculate their expected functional outputs. The three feeding structures differed in their form-to-function relationship from one-to-one (lower jaw lever ratio) to increasingly many-to-one (buccal suction index, opercular 4-bar linkage). We tested for (1) weaker linear correlations between phenotype and calculated function, and (2) less parallel evolution across lake- stream pairs, in the many-to-one systems relative to the one-to-one system. We confirm both predictions, thus supporting the theoretical expectation that increasing many-to-one mapping undermines parallel evolution. Therefore, sole consideration of morphological variation within and among populations might not serve as a proxy for functional variation when multiple adaptive trait combinations exist.

abstract = {AbstractEvidence of phenotypic parallelism is often used to infer the deterministic role played by natural selection. However, variation in the extent or direction of divergence is often evident among independent evolutionary replicates, raising the following question: just how parallel, overall, is parallel evolution? We answer this question through a comparative analysis of studies of fishes, a taxon where parallel evolution has been much discussed. We first ask how much of the among-population variance in phenotypic traits can be explained by different “environment” types, such as high predation versus low predation or benthic versus limnetic. We then use phenotypic change vector analysis to quantify variation in the direction (vector angles) and magnitude (vector lengths) of environment-associated divergence. All analyses show high variation in the extent of parallelism—from very high to very low, along with everything in between—highlighting the importance of quantifying parallelism rather than just ...},

The study was done in eight different varieties of Trifolium repens L. collected from different altitudinal zones such as subtropical representing Kirtipur (1245-1300 masl), subtropical to temperate representing Dhunche (1962 -2012masl) and temperate to sub-alpine representing Chandanbari (3400-3500masl). Plants collected from these areas were tested for HCN contents by “Feigl spot test” method. The results showed that highest quantity of HCN was present in WNML, medium in WPML and minimum in LPML variety growing at Kirtipur. Medium quantity of HCN was present in WNML, WPML, WPNML and PNML varieties growing at Dhunche. PML and LPNML varieties have no HCN and were suggested as the best fodder plants for livestock. HCN contents in plants growing in Chandanbari were very low or absent. Similarly, the transplant from Chandanbari to Kirtipur also did not show HCN except a medium amount in PNML variety. The study showed a marked variation in HCN content among the varieties of white clover. It also revealed that the higher amount of HCN was present in white coloured flower than pink coloured flower; HCN content of plant is lesser in colder and higher altitudinal zone and is higher in plant with larger size of the leaves as well as in plants growing in lower moisture and higher phosphorous containing soil.},

Flowering plants experience selection from other sources, including herbivores, which may enhance or oppose selection by pollinators. Surprisingly, few studies have examined selection from multiple sources on the same traits. We quantified pollinator-mediated selection on six floral traits of Lobelia cardinalis by comparing selection in naturally and supplementally (hand-) pollinated plants. Directional, quadratic and correlational selection gradients as well as total directional and quadratic selection differentials were examined. We used path analysis to examine how three herbivores slugs, weevils and caterpillars affected the relationship between floral traits and fitness. We detected stronger total selection on four traits and correlational selection (?ij) on three trait combinations in the natural pollination treatment, indicating that pollinators caused selection on these traits. Weak but statistically significant selection was caused by weevil larvae on stem diameter and anthernectary distance, and by slugs on median-flower date. In this study, pollinators imposed stronger selection than herbivores on floral traits in L. cardinalis. In general, the degree of pollen limitation and rate of herbivory are expected to influence the relative strength of selection caused by pollinators or herbivores.},

abstract = {The evolutionary response of plant populations to herbivore imposed selection for defense may theoretically be constrained by the costs of defense, yet few studies convincingly demonstrate such costs. We investigated possible constraints on the evolution of defense in rapid cycling Brassica rapa by divergently selecting lines for investment in foliar glucosinolate content, a chemical defense in this species. Costs would then result in a significant correlated response to artificially imposed selection in the direction opposite to the direct response of foliar glucosinolate production. Correlated responses of date of first flowering, total flower number, number of seeds per fruit, and mean seed mass were examined. After three generations of selection, there was a significant direct response in glucosinolate content of the leaves of B. rapa. Furthermore, we found significant correlated responses in both total flower production and number of seeds produced per fruit, but not date of first flowering or mean seed mass. Lines selected for high glucosinolates produced fewer flowers and seeds per fruit compared to those selected for low glucosinolates while lines selected for low glucosinolates showed the opposite response. Thus, costs of defense were demonstrated and may constrain the evolution of foliar glucosinolate production in this plant species.},

abstract = {1. Herbivores consume a large portion of the biomass produced by plants in virtually all ecosys- tems, which has dramatic effects on both the ecology and evolution of plants. In response to this threat, plants have evolved a diverse arsenal of direct and indirect defences to reduce herbivory and the impacts of damage on plant performance. 2. This special feature is a broad synthesis of the evolution and ecology of plant defences. The first objective of this special feature is to provide a review of what we have learned about plant defences against herbivores. The second objective is to stimulate debate and sow fresh ideas for the future research. 3. The 11 articles in this issue address three fundamental questions: (i) How do plants defend themselves against a diverse array of enemies? (ii) Why do plant species vary in defence? And (iii) What are the ecological and ecosystem-level consequences of plant defence? In addressing these questions the articles cover the interdisciplinary nature of plant–herbivore evolutionary ecology, from genes to global patterns. 4. The articles contained in the special feature question existing paradigms and provide new analyses of data. In some cases, influential hypotheses are firmly supported with new analyses (e.g. the Resource Availability Hypothesis), whereas in other instances conventional wisdom is called into question (e.g. the importance of secondary metabolites in the microevolution of resis- tance) and popular hypotheses are rejected (e.g. the Apparency Hypothesis, the Latitudinal Bio- tic Interaction Hypothesis). 5.

abstract = {Speciation often involves incremental responses to natural selection and results in large scale genomic changes, but it may also occur abruptly and with little genetic imprint, as seen in some complexes of cryptic species. Recent attention has focused on sexual selection in rapid speciation, because it can disrupt premating signals that mediate reproductive isolation. Some models require that environmental adaptation assist sexual selection during speciation, while others show that populations can diverge through mate choice alone. We propose that speciation involving environmental adaptation in premating signals is likely to have a polygenic basis, while speciation due to arbitrary changes in premating signals could be accompanied by changes at just a few loci. The sibling species Chrysoperla plorabunda and Chrysoperla johnsoni belong to a large complex of cryptic species of green lacewings, and meet all criteria for speciation via sexual selection. We perform a genetic analysis of line crosses between them, focusing on their substrate-borne premating songs. Measurements of seven song features and their principal components are compared among parentals, F1 and F2 hybrids, and backcrosses. The distributions of phenotypes are consistent with a model of more than one, but not many, genes. Sex linkage and/or maternal effects are negligible. C. plorabunda is dominant for most traits affecting mate choice. Bayesian analyses of segregation variance show significant additive and epistatic effects on line means. A Bayesian Castle-Wright estimate suggests that relatively few effective factors are responsible for variation in volley period (x = two factors), number of volleys per song (x = 1), and PC-1 (x = 4). Our results are consistent with simple genetic architecture of songs, supporting a role for major genes in premating isolation and strengthening the notion that mate choice alone, without significant environmental adaptation, has been responsible for generating new lacewing species.},

abstract = {Life on Earth is conspicuously more diverse in the tropics. Although this intriguing geographical pattern has been linked to many biotic and abiotic factors, their relative importance and potential interactions are still poorly understood. The way in which latitudinal changes in ecological conditions influence evolutionary processes is particularly controversial, as there is evidence for both a positive and a negative latitudinal gradient in speciation rates. Here, we identify and address some methodological issues (how patterns are analysed and how latitude is quantified) that could lead to such conflicting results. To address these issues, we assemble a comprehensive data set of the environmental correlates of latitude (including climate, net primary productivity and habitat heterogeneity) and combine it with biological, historical and molecular data to explore global patterns in recent divergence events (subspeciation). Surprisingly, we find that the harsher conditions that typify temperate habitats (lower primary productivity, decreased rainfall and more variable and unpredictable temperatures) are positively correlated with greater subspecies richness in terrestrial mammals and birds. Thus, our findings indicate that intraspecific divergence is greater in regions with lower biodiversity, a pattern that is robust to both sampling variation and latitudinal biases in taxonomic knowledge. We discuss possible causal mechanisms for the link between environmental harshness and subspecies richness (faster rates of evolution, greater likelihood of range discontinuities and more opportunities for divergence) and conclude that this pattern supports recent indications that latitudinal gradients of diversity are maintained by simultaneously higher potentials for both speciation and extinction in temperate than tropical regions.},

abstract = {The quantification of urban–rural gradi- ents using urbanization measures has become stan- dard practice in many urban ecological studies. Nonetheless, the choice of urbanization measures for a specific urban gradient still remains problem- atic. Increasing numbers of papers stress the impor- tance of comparative urban ecological research, in an attempt to contribute to an understanding of the ecology ‘of' cities. This implies that research in diverse urban areas globally should be comparable. This study follows an approach to quantify the urban– rural gradient in Klerksdorp previously followed in Melbourne, Australia with the goal to help elucidate the viability of creating a standard set of urbanization measures that is useful across continents. Satellite imagery and spatial analysis were used to calculate the values of 12 urbanization measures across a 900 km2 landscape grid. Principal components anal- ysis is commonly used to identify smaller subsets of measures to quantify urban–rural gradients. The results of this study indicate that factor analysis is more suitable than principal components analysis and ideal in identifying these independent measures of urbanization. The factor analysis revealed that land- scape structure and demographic attributes are both essential characteristics of a city that needs to be accounted for in the choice of urbanization measures. Additionally, we identified seven aspects influencing the direct comparison of cities, namely: scale of analysis, spatial resolution, classification typology, accuracy of input data, specific measure equations, the type of statistical analysis and the habitat context. These aspects must be taken into consideration and resolved before effective comparative gradient research between cities can be achieved.},

In addition, well-resolved molecular phylogenies derived from these DNA barcode sequences have the potential to improve investigations of the mechanisms underlying community assembly and functional trait evolution. To date, no studies have effectively applied DNA barcodes sensu strictu in this manner. In this report, we demonstrate that a three-locus DNA barcode when applied to 296 species of woody trees, shrubs, and palms found within the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, resulted in {\textgreater}98{\%} correct identifications. These DNA barcode sequences are also used to reconstruct a robust community phylogeny employing a supermatrix method for 281 of the 296 plant species in the plot. The three-locus barcode data were sufficient to reliably reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the plant taxa in the plot that are congruent with the broadly accepted phylogeny of flowering plants (APG II). Earlier work on the phylogenetic structure of the BCI forest dynamics plot employing less resolved phylogenies reveals significant differences in evolutionary and ecological inferences compared with our data and suggests that unresolved community phylogenies may have increased type I and type II errors. These results illustrate how highly resolved phylogenies based on DNA barcode sequence data will enhance research focused on the interface between community ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {Communication is vital to the survival and reproductive success of organisms. There is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise interferes with acoustic communication. While recent studies have tested whether signallers behaviourally modify their signals to prevent masking from noise, studies have only recently begun to test whether noise in fact interferes with the perception of acoustic signals. In this study, we investigated how road noise affects both male signalling and female phonotaxis in Oecanthus tree crickets. Acoustic signals of tree crickets, which are relatively low amplitude and composed primarily of low frequencies, are likely to be masked by road noise. To determine whether males alter their calls in the presence of road noise, we assessed how a playback of recorded road noise changed four male calling characteristics: dominant frequency, call amplitude, total time spent calling and latency to begin calling. We then used response trials to test the ability of females to localize and respond to male calls in the presence of road noise. Unlike studies in other organisms, which detected quantifiable differences in male signal characteristics, male tree crickets were less likely to call but did not change signal characteristics. Surprisingly, female response to male signals was not affected by the presence of road noise, despite the potential masking effects of road noise. Because tree crickets often communicate in environments with many species of calling insects, tree crickets may be adapted to tolerate novel sources of acoustic interference. This study presents a case where male signals and female responses are not affected by road noise. Since species are differentially affected by noise, detailed understanding of behaviour and sensory systems may be necessary for predicting the effect of acoustic interference on trophic interactions and population dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Populations of A. canescens from different habitats of the Chihuahuan Desert (New Mexico, USA) were analyzed using flow cytometry to determine ploidy levels. Traits related to xylem water transport efficiency and safety against drought-induced hydraulic failure were measured in both stems and leaves. At the stem level, cytotypes of higher ploidy showed consistently lower leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity but greater resistance to drought-induced loss of hydraulic conductivity. At the leaf level, comparisons in hydraulics between cytotypes did not show a consistent pattern, but exhibited high plasticity to proximal environmental conditions related to soil water availability. The results suggest that a trade-off between stem hydraulic efficiency and safety across ploidy levels underlies niche differentiation among different cytotypes of A. canescens. Polyploidization may have been facilitated by environmental heterogeneity related to water availability, and variation in water-related physiology found in the present study suggests an important functional basis for the niche differentiation and coexistence of A. canescens cytotypes in desert environments.},

abstract = {Broad-scale assessments of how climate change might impact mountain ecosystems, especially in areas of high biodiversity and endemism, are compromised by the lack of localised climate feedback in global circulation models. Here, we use regionally downscaled climate models to highlight how spatial variation in forecast change could impact rare plant distributions differentially across the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya, part of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot. Concordant with the theory that climatic stability facilitates the accumulation of rare species, we find significant positive correlations between endemic plant richness and future climatic persistence within the dispersal-limiting sky islands of this mountain archipelago. Further, we explore the hypothesis that mountain plants will move upslope in response to climate change and find that, conversely, some species are predicted to tend downslope, despite warmer annual conditions, driven by changes in seasonality and water availability. Importantly, two thirds of the modelled plant species are predicted to respond in different directions in different parts of their ranges, exemplifying the potential for individualistic responses of species and disjunct populations to environmental change, and the need for regional focus in climate change impact assessment. Conservation planners, and more broadly those charged with developing climate adaption policy, are advised to take caution in inferring local patterns of change from zoomed perspectives of broad-scale models. Moreover, a preoccupation with mean annual temperature as the principal driver of ecosystem change is misguided and could compromise efforts to make conservation plans resilient to future climate change. Faced with spatially complex and inherently uncertain future conditions, sensible priorities are to restore forest connectivity and to underpin adaption strategies with knowledge of how ecosystems and people have adapted to previous episodes of rapid change.},

abstract = {The relationship between fleshy-fruited plants and their vertebrate seed dispersal agents often has been depicted as subject to important interannual variation, but no study has thus far documented such variation on a long-term basis. This paper presents the results of a 12-yr investigation on fleshy-fruited plants and avian frugivores in a Mediterranean montane locality of southeastern Spain. The main objective was to document patterns and correlates of long-term variation in the composition and abundance of fruits and birds, with particular reference to seed dispersers. During October-December ("autumn" period) 1978-1990, abundance of ripe fruits and birds was assessed in a 4-ha plot in dense, well-preserved sclerophyllous scrub, by means of counts in permanent plots and mist-netting, respectively. Diet composition and fruit preference patterns of Erithacus rubecula and Sylvia atricapilla, the two most abundant seed dispersers, were also investigated over the same period, using fecal sample analyses. Possible consequences to the birds of annual variation in fruit supply and diet composition were investigated using data on fat deposition levels and recapture rates of mist-netted individuals. Total fruit abundance (i.e., mean ripe fruit density of all species combined) fluctuated among years between 5.4 +/- 11.1 fruits/m(2) (mean +/- 1 SD; 1986) and 77.1 +/- 78.0 fruits/m(2) (1989) and was positively related to the amount of rainfall in the preceding spring. Not all fruiting species bore ripe fruits every year, and among those species that did, fruit density fluctuated asynchronously and to variable degrees. Seven out of 13 species exhibited significant supra-annual periodicity in fruit abundance, with fluctuation periods ranging from 2 to 6 yr. Variation in the abundance of each of the six most abundant fruit species was unrelated to annual variation in rainfall. The autumn bird assemblage at the study site was made up of year-round resident species (54.1{\%} of captures, all years combined) that were largely fruit predators (feeding on pulp or seeds without performing dispersal) and of autumn-winter resident species (45.5{\%} of captures) that were largely seed dispersers. Bird abundance, all species combined, ranged between 27.1 and 61.5 captures/100 net-hours for 1987 and 1986, respectively. Depending on year, seed dispersers made up 25.6-75.4{\%} of the total captures, and fruit predators made up 20.9-69.7{\%}. The relative importance of nonfrugivores was always negligible (1.1-9.9{\%}). No correlation existed across years between total fruit abundance and the capture rates of all bird species combined, seed dispersers, or fruit predators. Annual variation in the abundance of seed dispersers was positively related to November mean maximum temperature. At the individual species level, S. atricapilla capture rates were correlated with the abundance of the fruits of Phillyrea latifolia, a species exhibiting extreme annual fluctuations. Annual variation in the importance of fruits in the diet of S. atricapilla and E. rubecula was not significantly related to changes in fruit abundance. Composition of the fruit diet of these species fluctuated markedly among years, and there was little agreement between composition of the diet and of the fruit supply. Certain fruit species were significantly preferred, and others avoided, by both S. atricapilla and E. rubecula. Ranking of interspecific fruit preferences remained consistent among years and was related to differences in carbohydrate and lipid content of fruit pulp. Fat deposition levels of S. atricapilla and E. rubecula did not vary among years and were not significantly related to fruit abundance, percentage of fruit volume in the diet, or contribution of lipid-rich fruits to the diet. Return rates of individuals of these species to the study locality in successive wintering periods were very low, and not significantly related to diet composition or fruit abundance. Prevalence of abiotic over biotic determinants of annual variations, extensive decoupling of the long-term temporal dynamics of fruits and dispersers, and the remarkable "indifference" of frugivores to variations in the fruit supply all point to the non-equilibrial nature of this assemblage of fleshy-fruited plants and their avian dispersers.},

abstract = {Urbanization significantly alters natural ecosystems and has accelerated globally. Urban wildlife populations are often highly fragmented by human infrastructure, and isolated populations may adapt in response to local urban pressures. However, relatively few studies have identified genomic signatures of adaptation in urban animals. We used a landscape genomics approach to examine signatures of selection in urban populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in New York City. We analyzed 154,770 SNPs identified from transcriptome data from 48 P. leucopus individuals from three urban and three rural populations, and used outlier tests to identify evidence of urban adaptation. We accounted for demography by simulating a neutral SNP dataset under an inferred demographic history as a null model for outlier analysis. We also tested whether candidate genes were associated with environmental variables related to urbanization. In total, we detected 381 outlier loci and after stringent filtering, identified and annotated 19 candidate loci. Many of the candidate genes were involved in metabolic processes, and have well-established roles in metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Our results indicate that white-footed mice in NYC are adapting at the biomolecular level to local selective pressures in urban habitats. Annotation of outlier loci suggest selection is acting on metabolic pathways in urban populations, likely related to novel diets in cities that differ from diets in less disturbed areas.},

abstract = {The formation of hybrids among closely related species has been observed in numerous plant taxa. Selection by pollinators on floral traits can act as an early reproductive isolating barrier and may be especially important when there is overlap in distribution and flowering time. In this study, we use Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping based on 293 codominant SNP markers in an F2 population (n = 328) to assess the size, magnitude, and location of the genetic regions controlling floral traits known to be important for pollinator attraction in 2 species of Lousiana Irises, Iris fulva and Iris hexagona. We also evaluate correlations among F2 traits and identify transgression in the hybrid population. Overall, we observe that differences in most floral traits between I. fulva and I. hexagona are controlled by multiple QTLs and are distributed across several linkage groups. We also find evidence of transgression at several QTL, suggesting that hybridization can contribute to generating phenotypic variation, which may be adaptive in rapidly changing environments.},

abstract = {A considerable fraction of the world's biodiversity is of recent evolutionary origin and has evolved as a by-product of, and is maintained by, divergent adaptation in heterogeneous environments. Conservationists have paid attention to genetic homogenization caused by human-induced translocations (e.g. biological invasions and stocking), and to the importance of environmental heterogeneity for the ecological coexistence of species. However, far less attention has been paid to the consequences of loss of environmental heterogeneity to the genetic coexistence of sympatric species. Our review of empirical observations and our theoretical considerations on the causes and consequences of interspecific hybridization suggest that a loss of environmental heterogeneity causes a loss of biodiversity through increased genetic admixture, effectively reversing speciation. Loss of heterogeneity relaxes divergent selection and removes ecological barriers to gene flow between divergently adapted species, promoting interspecific introgressive hybridization. Since heterogeneity of natural environments is rapidly deteriorating in most biomes, the evolutionary ecology of speciation reversal ought to be fully integrated into conservation biology.},

abstract = {Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) is an improvement upon the reciprocal averaging (RA) ordination technique. RA has two main faults: the second axis is often an ‘arch' or ‘horseshoe' distortion of the first axis, and distances in the ordination space do not have a consistent meaning in terms of compositional change (in particular, distances at the ends of the first RA axis are compressed relative to the middle). DCA corrects these two faults. Tests with simulated and field data show DCA superior to RA and to nonmetric multidimensional sealing in giving clear, interpretable results. DCA has several advantages. (a) Its performance is the best of the ordination techniques tested, and both species and sample ordinations are produced simultaneously. (b) The axes are scaled in standard deviation units with a definite meaning, (c) As implemented in a FORTRAN program called DECORANA, computing time rises only linearly with the amount of data analyzed, and only positive entries in the data matrix are stored in memory, so very large data sets present no difficulty. However, DCA has limitations, making it best to remove extreme outliers and discontinuities prior to analysis. DCA consistently gives the most interpretable ordination results, but as always the interpretation of results remains a matter of ecological insight and is improved by field experience and by integration of supplementary environmental data for the vegetation sample sites.},

Here, we investi-gated the contributions of both for differences in body shape in two species of Lake Malawi cichlids using wild-caught specimens and a common garden experiment. We further hybridized the two species to investigate the mode of gene action influencing body shape differences and to examine the potential for transgressive segregation. We found that body shape differences between the two species observed in the field are maintained after more than 10 generations in a standardized environment. Nonetheless, both species experienced similar changes in the laboratory environment. Our hybrid cross experiment confirmed that substantial variation in body shape ap-pears to be genetically determined. The data further suggest that the underlying mode of gene action is complex and cannot be explained by simple additive or additive-dominance models. Transgressive phenotypes were found in the hybrid generations, as hybrids occupied significantly more morphospace than both parentals combined. Further, the body shapes of transgressive individuals resemble the body shapes ob-served in other Lake Malawi rock-dwelling genera. Our findings indicate that body shape can respond to selection immediately, through plasticity, and over longer time-scales through adaptation. In addition, our results suggest that hybridization may have played an important role in the diversification of Lake Malawi cichlids through creating new phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {Connectivity of populations influences the degree to which species maintain genetic diversity and persist despite local extinctions. Natural landscape features are known to influence connectivity, but global anthropogenic landscape change underscores the importance of quantifying how human-modified landscapes disrupt connectivity of natural populations. Grasslands of western North America have experienced extensive habitat alteration, fragmenting populations of species such as black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Population sizes and the geographic range of prairie dogs have been declining for over a century due to habitat loss, disease, and eradication efforts. In many places, prairie dogs have persisted in the face of emerging urban landscapes that carve habitat into smaller and smaller fragments separated by uninhabitable areas. In extreme cases, prairie dog colonies are completely bounded by urbanization. Connectivity is particularly important for prairie dogs because colonies suffer high probabilities of extirpation by plague, and dispersal permits recolonization. Here we explore connectivity of prairie dog populations using analyses of 11 microsatellite loci for 9 prairie dog colonies spanning the fragmented landscape of Boulder County, Colorado. Isolation-by-resistance modeling suggests that wetlands and high intensity urbanization limit movement of prairie dogs. However, prairie dogs appear to move moderately well through low intensity development (including roads) and freely through cropland and grassland. Additionally, there is a marked decline in gene flow between colonies with increasing geographic distance, indicating isolation by distance even in an altered landscape. Our results suggest that prairie dog colonies retain some connectivity despite fragmentation by urbanization and agricultural development.},

abstract = {We analyzed the genetic basis of morphological differences between two wild species of teosinte (Zea diploperennis and Z. mays ssp. parviglumis), which are relatives of maize. These two species differ in a number of taxonomically important traits including the structure of the tassel (male inflorescence), which is the focus of this report. To investigate the genetic inheritance of six tassel traits, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with 95 RFLP markers was employed on a population of 425 F2 plants. Each trait was analyzed by interval mapping (IM) and composite interval mapping (CIM) to identify and characterize the QTL controlling the differences in tassel morphology. We detected two to eight QTL for each trait. In total, 30 QTL with IM and 33 QTL with CIM were found for tassel morphology. QTL for several of the traits mapped near each other, suggesting pleiotropy and/or linkage of QTL. The QTL showed small to moderate magnitudes of effect. No QTL of exceptionally large effect were found as seen under domestication and in the case of some other natural species. Thus, the model involving major QTL of large effect seems not to apply to the traits and species analyzed. A mixture of QTL with positive and negative allelic effects was found for most tassel traits and may suggest a history of periodic changes in the direction of selection during the divergence of Z. diploperennis and Z. mays ssp. parviglumis or fixation of QTL alleles by random genetic drift rather than selection.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic architecture of traits involved in premating isolation between recently diverged lineages can provide valuable insight regarding the mode and tempo of speciation. The repeated coevolution of male courtship song and female preference across the species radiation of Laupala crickets presents an unusual opportunity to compare the genetic basis of divergence across independent evolutionary histories. Previous studies of one pair of species revealed a polygenic basis (including a significant X chromosome contribution) to quantitative differences in male song and female acoustic preference. Here, we studied interspecific crosses between two phenotypically less-diverged species that represents a phylogenetically independent occurrence of intersexual signalling evolution. We found patterns consistent with an additive polygenic basis to differentiation in both song and preference (n(E) = 5.3 and 5.1 genetic factors, respectively), and estimate a moderate contribution of the X chromosome (7.6{\%}) of similar magnitude to that observed for Laupala species with nearly twice the phenotypic divergence. Together, these findings suggest a similar genetic architecture underlying the repeated evolution of sexual characters in this genus and provide a counterexample to prevailing theory predicting an association between early lineage divergence and sex-linked 'major genes'.},

abstract = {Mountain systems throughout the globe are characterized by high levels of species richness and species endemism. Biodi- versity, however, is not distributed evenly with altitude, but often declines from mid to high altitudes. Conversely, endemic species may be over-represented at high altitudes. Upward elevational range shifts of mountain species have been reported in response to ongoing changes in climate, yet the reports are dominated by studies on woody species and mountains at high latitudes. We investigated spatial and temporal changes in the mountain biodiversity in the subtropical island of Taiwan, based on historical survey and resurvey data during the period 1906–2006. We found that upper altitudinal limits of mountain plant distributions have risen by ca 3.6 m yr  1 during the last century, in parallel with rising temperatures in the region. Although species, genus, and family richness decline with altitude, ca 55{\%} of species at the highest altitudes are endemic to the island. Given the steep decline in land area with increasing elevation, these high altitude areas are dispropor- tionately important for plant biodiversity when richness and endemism are standardized by available land area. We argue that the distributional shift that we report, in combination with the altitudinal distribution of plant diversity, is likely to pose a major threat to high mountain species of this highly biodiverse island, a threat that is becoming increasingly evident for high mountain plants throughout the globe},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The degree of genetic differentiation among populations experiencing high levels of gene flow is expected to be low for neutral genomic sites, but substantial divergence can occur in sites subject to directional selection. Studies of highly mobile marine fish populations provide an opportunity to investigate this kind of heterogeneous genomic differentiation, but most studies to this effect have focused on a relatively low number of genetic markers and/or few populations. Hence, the patterns and extent of genomic divergence in high-gene flow marine fish populations remain poorly understood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We here investigated genome-wide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation in 10 marine populations of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) distributed across a steep salinity and temperature gradient in the Baltic Sea, by utilizing {\textgreater} 30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms obtained with a pooled RAD-seq approach. We found that genetic diversity and differentiation varied widely across the genome, and identified numerous fairly narrow genomic regions exhibiting signatures of both divergent and balancing selection. Evidence was uncovered for substantial genetic differentiation associated with both salinity and temperature gradients, and many candidate genes associated with local adaptation in the Baltic Sea were identified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation, as well as candidate genes associated with adaptation in Baltic Sea sticklebacks were similar to those observed in earlier comparisons between marine and freshwater populations, suggesting that similar processes may be driving adaptation to brackish and freshwater environments. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence for heterogenic genomic divergence driven by local adaptation in the face of gene flow along an environmental gradient in the post-glacially formed Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {Female fertility in flowering plants is commonly observed to be submaximal. The fraction of ovules in a flower that produce seeds is commonly less than 1.00, particularly in outcrossing species. Here we investigate through controlled pollinations factors that may contribute toward low seed : ovule ratios in Trillium gran- diflorum, a self-incompatible woodland herb from eastern North America. Reduced fruit and seed set in open- pollinated plants in comparison with hand cross-pollinated plants demonstrated that pollen limitation was a contributing factor to low female fertility. However, seed : ovule ratios of hand cross-pollinated flowers av- eraged only 0.66. Experimental pollinations involving the manipulation of pollen age, the number of pollen donors, the timing of pollination, and the application of self-pollen before cross-pollen each had no effect on fertility. This indicated that aspects of pollen delivery were not responsible for low seed : ovule ratios and that resources might influence variation in seed : ovule ratios. An analysis of the relation between plant size and seed set in hand cross-pollinated plants provided evidence that resources limited fertility when ovules of T. grandiflorum were not pollen limited. We discuss these results in the context of the stochastic pollination environment that characterizes the early spring flowering period of T. grandiflorum},

abstract = {Asclepiadaceae are the dicot counterparts to the Orchidaceae, which also transmit their pollen grains in large groups within pollinia. Unlike many terrestrial, nectar-producing orchids, however, milkweeds are characterized by low fruit-set, typically averaging 1-5{\%}. Transfer of hundreds of pollen grains as a unit makes it possible to quantify pollinator activity and male and female reproductive success more directly and more easily in milkweeds than in plants with loose pollen grains. It also leads to the production of fruits whose seeds all share a single father, thus simplifying paternity analysis. Recent anatomical work has demonstrated that three of the five stigmatic chambers of milkweed flowers transmit pollen tubes to one of the two separate ovaries, whereas the other two chambers transmit only to the second ovary. Milkweed flowers are long-lived and produce copious nectar, which flows from nectaries within the stigmatic chambers to fill the hoods, which serve as reservoirs. Nectar also serves as the germination fluid for pollen grains, but concentrations above 30{\%} inhibit germination. Most milkweeds are genetically self-incompatible and express an unusual late-acting form of ovarian rejection. Some weedy milkweeds, however, are self-compatible, and levels of self-insertion of pollinia are apparently high in these, as well as in self-incompatible, species. Early attempts to explain the evolution of inflorescence size in milkweeds were hampered by failure to consider the genetic basis of the variation observed and by failure to determine the unit on which selection should act. Direct tests of the "pollen donation" hypothesis have cast doubt on the validity of the view that flower number and other floral traits evolved primarily to enhance male reproductive success. Milkweeds are pollinated by a diverse array of large bees, wasps, and butterflies, and these generalist pollinators effect extensive gene flow within and between populations, augmented by wind dispersal of comose seeds. Morphological and biochemical evidence support the view that limited, localized hybridization occurs between sympatric species of milkweeds. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1994 Annual Reviews},

abstract = {If genetic constraints are important, then rates and direction of evolution should be related to trait evolvability. Here we use recently developed measures of evolvability to test the genetic constraint hypothesis with quantitative genetic data on floral morphology from the Neotropical vine Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae). These measures were compared against rates of evolution and patterns of divergence among 24 populations in two species in the D. scandens species complex. We found clear evidence for genetic constraints, particularly among traits that were tightly phenotypically integrated. This relationship between evolvability and evolutionary divergence is puzzling, because the estimated evolvabilities seem too large to constitute real constraints. We suggest that this paradox can be explained by a combination of weak stabilizing selection around moving adaptive optima and small realized evolvabilities relative to the observed additive genetic variance.},

In this study we quantified a range of floral and foliar traits within the genus Hakea to investigate how pollinator and herbivore selection might influence the evolution of floral attraction and defence attributes. * Plant material was collected from populations of 51 Australian Hakea species native to southwestern Australia, and measurements were taken of foliage and inflorescence morphology, inflorescence colour and floral chemical defence. Hakeas were separated into bird- vs insect-pollinated species on the basis of stigma-nectary distance. * Our results show how the evolution of insect vs bird pollination is closely linked to whether inflorescences are protected by physical (leaf spines, dense foliage) or chemical (floral cyanide) defences, respectively. * Rather than being constrained by the necessity to attract pollinators, we suggest that pre-existing adaptations to combat florivore and herbivore attack directed the evolution of floral characteristics employed to attract pollinators and deter florivores. The inter-correlation among bird pollination, red flower colour and floral cyanide indicates floral coloration may signal to vertebrate florivores that the inflorescences are unpalatable despite their high accessibility.},

Fitness of between-species hybrids usually sharply decreases with the divergence time of the concerned species and the divergence depth, which still allows for a successful crossing differs among principal clades of vertebrates. Recently, a review of hybridization events among distinct lizard species revealed that lizards belong to vertebrates with a highly developed ability to hybridize. In spite of this, reliable reports of experimental hybridizations between genetically fairly divergent species are only exceptional. Here, we show the results of the crossing of two distinct allopatric species of eyelid geckos possessing temperature sex determination and lacking sex chromosomes: Eublepharis macularius distributed in Pakistan/Afghanistan area and E. angramainyu, which inhabits Mesopotamia and adjacent areas. We demonstrated that F1 hybrids were viable and fertile, and the introgression of E. angramainyu genes into the E. macularius genome can be enabled via a backcrossing. The examined hybrids (except those of the F2 generation) displayed neither malformations nor a reduced survival. Analyses of morphometric and coloration traits confirmed phenotypic distinctness of both parental species and their F1 hybrids. These findings contrast with long-term geographic and an evolutionary separation of the studied species. Thus, the occurrence of fertile hybrids of comparably divergent species, such as E. angramainyu and E. macularius, may also be expected in other taxa of squamates. This would violate the current estimates of species diversity in lizards.},

Experiments with the top minnow, Mollienisia formosa. are described. It is viviparous and apparently parthenogenetic and the hybrid young are always females exactly like the mother. "Hybrids" were even produced when this spp. was mated with Gambusia affinis, belonging to a different subfamily. In other instances hybrids are nearly always intermediate in their characters between the parental spp. Hybrids, although common among fresh-water spp., are rare among marine spp., but in one group, the flatfishes, hybrids are fairly common. Examples are mentioned of hybrids among the chars, trouts, salmons, herrings, whitefish and suckers. Charts illustrate hybridization in various families with indications of known experimental and natural hybrids between subgenera and genera. Hybridization is largely due to environmental factors. Spp. that hybridize rarely in nature may cross commonly in the laboratory. Environmental changes are more common in fresh waters than in the sea, hence the more common occurrence of hybrids in the former than in the latter. Frequency of hybridization is inversely related to the number of spp. in a region. This fact, as well as the sterility of the hybrids, indicates that crossing of spp. is not an important factor in speciation of fishes, as a general rule. ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Irving Fox},

Gigantism in pond nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius Linnaeus, 1758) has been repeatedly observed, but the quantitative genetic basis of population divergence in size has remained unstudied.We conducted a common garden experiment – using ‘pure' and reciprocal crosses between two populations (‘giant' pond versus ‘normal' marine) – to test for the relative importance of additive genetic, non-additive genetic, and maternal effects on body size after 11 months of growth in the laboratory. We found that body size difference between the two populations in laboratory conditions owed mainly to additive genetic effects, and only to a minor degree to maternal effects. Furthermore, the weak maternal effects were seen only in the offspring of ‘giant' mothers, and appeared to be mediated through differences in egg size. Thus, the results suggest that gigantism in pond populations of P. pungitius is based on the effects of additively acting genes, rather than to direct environmental induction, or maternal or non-additive gene action.},

abstract = {Acoustic signals are usually very effective in long-distance communication. However, in many habitats animals suffer more and more from signal interference caused by traffic-generated low-frequency noise. Recent observations suggest that birds are able to change the pitch of their song to reduce masking interference, but we still lack experimental evidence. Theoretically, some bird species, when confronted with increased noise levels, may be able to switch to song types in their repertoire with higher frequencies. We tested this hypothesis in the great tit, Parus major, by exposing singing males to low-frequency 'city' noise in their natural territories and comparing frequency characteristics of songs before and after song type switching. We also exposed birds to high-frequency, 'inverse' city noise, as well as to white noise as a control. Great tits adjusted temporal switching behaviour in response to noise exposure. Song types that were less masked by the noise treatment were sung for longer durations. As a result, all five birds that switched during the low-frequency noise treatment switched to song types with a higher minimum frequency. Similarly, seven of nine birds that switched while exposed to high-frequency noise switched to song types with lower maximum frequencies. These results provide experimental evidence for a short-term behavioural mechanism explaining noise-dependent frequency use in birdsong. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

For 4 yr, I induced plant resistance to insect herbivores in tomato plants using the natural plant hormone jasmonic acid. Foliar jasmonic acid application increased levels of polyphenol oxidase, an oxidative enzyme implicated in resistance against several insect herbivores. Induced plants received 60{\%} less leaf damage than did control plants. I then looked at the effects of this induction on seedling survivorship, phenology, fruit production, and plant biomass in the presence and absence of herbivores. Induced plants produced fewer flowers than control plants, but this did not translate into differences in yield between treatments. In addition, there was no difference in yield between induced and control plants under natural anti experimentally reduced herbivore levels. This lack of effect on yield may have been caused by low levels of herbivory in the unmanipulated controls. Thus, it appears that jasmonic acid induces resistance in tomato plants and that this resistance produces no measurable costs to tomato plants. Elicitors such as jasmonic acid may be valuable pest management tools, especially when there are high densities of herbivores},

abstract = {While the spatial aspect of hybridization has been investigated in depth, the temporal aspect has not. We analysed the seasonal hybridization dynamics of a multivoltine non-biting midge sister species pair, Chironomus riparius and C. piger. We investigated the fertility and fitness of F 1 hybrids, and all possible first-generation backcross hybrids, under different temperature conditions. Based on microsatellite markers, we then inferred the presence of different hybrid classes in seasonal field samples (spring and autumn) from a site of co-occurrence over two consecutive years. All experimental hybrids showed reduced fertility albeit without a specific temperature effect. Fitness was zero in one F 1 direction, but not reduced in the other. No sex ratio distortion was observed. However, fitness was reduced in all backcrosses, indicating that hybridization should be rare in the field. In the seasonal samples, C. piger was found only in autumn individuals. All 359 genotyped individuals were attributed to either of the pure species. However, several individuals of the autumn samples carried signs of later generation introgression, indicating that actual hybridization must take place recurrently during summer. We thus present evidence that seasonal environmental changes can drive hybridization dynamics and that long-term recurrent hybridization need not affect species integrity.

abstract = {The reciprocal evolutionary relationships of butterflies and their food plants have been examined on the basis of an extensive survey of patterns of plant utilization and information on factors affecting food plant choice. The evolution of secondary plant substances and the stepwise evolutionary responses to these by phytophagous organisms have clearly been the dominant factors in the evolution of butterflies and other phytophagous groups. Furthermore, these secondary plant substances have probably been critical in the evolution of angiosperm subgroups and perhaps of the angiosperms themselves. The examination of broad patterns of coevolution permits several levels of predictions and shows promise as a route to the understanding of community evolution. Little information useful for the reconstruction of phylogenies is supplied. It is apparent that reciprocal selective responses have been greatly underrated as a factor in the origination of organic diversity. The paramount importance of plant-herbivore interactions in generating terrestrial diversity is suggested. For instance, viewed in this framework the rich diversity of tropical communities may be traced in large part to the hospitality of warm climates toward poikilothermal phytophagous insects.},

abstract = {Ecological speciation occurs when adaptation to different environments or resources causes the evolution of reproductive isolation. This process is now thought to be very important in the evolution of biological diversity. Indeed, support for ecological speciation is so often asserted in the literature that one can get the impression of ubiquity. Eager to ride on the coattails of this exciting work, my own research has investigated ecological speciation in guppies, sticklebacks, and Darwin's finches. Much to my initial dismay, I failed to find simple and strong signatures of ecological speciation in the first two of these systems. Setting aside the possibility of personal incompetence, my apparent deviation from ubiquity might simply reflect an existing literature bias. This bias seems obvious in retrospect given that essentially all published studies of ecological speciation purport to be confirmatory, whereas many cases of divergent selection and adaptive divergence are associated with only weak to modest levels of reproductive isolation. In short, different populations can be arrayed along a continuum from panmixia to complete reproductive isolation. Variation along this continuum might profitably be used for studying factors, outlined herein, that can promote or constrain "progress" toward ecological speciation.},

abstract = {? 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature. All rights reserved.Intraspecific hybrid zones involving long-lived woody species are rare and can provide insights into the genetic basis of early-diverging traits in speciation. Within the landscape-dominant Hawaiian tree, Metrosideros polymorpha, are morphologically distinct successional varieties, incana and glaberrima, that dominate new and old lava flows, respectively, below 1200 me on volcanically active Hawai'i Island, with var. glaberrima also extending to higher elevations and bogs. Here, we use morphological measurements on 86 adult trees to document the presence of an incana-glaberrima hybrid zone on the 1855 Mauna Loa lava flow on east Hawai'i Island and parent-offspring analysis of 1311 greenhouse seedlings from 71 crosses involving 72 adults to estimate heritabilities and genetic correlations among vegetative traits. Both the variation in adult leaf pubescence at the site and the consistency between adult and offspring phenotypes suggest the presence of two hybrid classes, F 1 s and var. incana backcrosses, as would be expected on a relatively young lava flow. Nine nuclear microsatellite loci failed to distinguish parental and hybrid genotypes. All four leaf traits examined showed an additive genetic basis with moderate to strong heritabilities, and genetic correlations were stronger for the more range-restricted var. incana. The differences between varieties in trait values, heritabilities and genetic correlations, coupled with high genetic variation within but low genetic variation between varieties, are consistent with a multi-million-year history of alternating periods of disruptive selection in contrasting environments and admixture in ephemeral hybrid zones. Finally, the contrasting genetic architectures suggest different evolutionary trajectories of leaf traits in these forms.},

abstract = {We present evidence of ecological character displacement among species of three- spined sticklebacks that inhabit small lakes of coastal British Columbia. Geological data suggest that the populations resulted from multiple divergence and speciation events over the past 13,000 yr. In lakes with two species, one is invariably "limnetic" in morphology and habitat, and the other is "benthic." Other lakes contain a single form morphologically intermediate between sympatric species and exploiting both habitats. Within solitary populations individuals exploit one habitat or the other according to their morphology, which underscores the divergent selec- tion pressures operating on either side of the habitat boundary. Our results satisfy at least four of the six major criteria for demonstrating the occurrence of character displacement: (1) a statistical null model of no displacement is easily rejected; (2) variation between and within populations is genetically based; (3) differences in sympatry reflect evolutionary shifts, not merely the biased extinction of similar forms; and (4) morphology is closely linked to resource use. Minimal resource differences between one- and two-species lakes and the presence of competition between similar phenotypes are still to be established. Our data suggest that compe- tition for food has played a critical role in the divergence between species. We consider the possibility that it also helped in species formation, which would expand its potential role in adaptive radiation.},

abstract = {Hybrid incompatibilities, measured as mortality and sterility, are caused by the disruption of gene interactions. They are important post-zygotic isolation barriers to species hybridization, and much effort is put into the discovery of the genes underlying these incompatibilities. In hybridization studies of the haplodiploid parasitic wasp genus Nasonia, genic incompatibilities have been shown to affect mortality and sterility. The genomic regions associated with mortality have been found to depend on the cytotype of the hybrids and thus suggest cytonuclear incompatibilities. As environmental conditions can affect gene expression and gene interaction, we here investigate the effect of developmental temperature on sterility and mortality in Nasonia hybrids. Results show that extreme temperatures strongly affect both hybrid sterility (mainly spermatogenic failure) and mortality. Molecular mapping revealed that extreme temperatures increase transmission ratio distortion of parental alleles at incompatible loci, and thus, cryptic incompatible loci surface under temperature stress that remain undiscovered under standard temperatures. Our results underline the sensitivity of hybrid incompatibilities to environmental factors and the effects of unstable epistasis.},

abstract = {Chromosomal rearrangements can contribute to the evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation directly, by disrupting meiosis in F1 hybrids, or indirectly, by suppressing recombination among genic incompatibilities. Because direct effects of rearrangements on fertility imply fitness costs during their spread, understanding the mechanism of F1 hybrid sterility is integral to reconstructing the role(s) of rearrangements in speciation. In hybrids between monkeyflowers Mimulus cardinalis and Mimulus lewisii, rearrangements contain all quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for both premating barriers and pollen sterility, suggesting that they may have facilitated speciation in this model system. We used artificial chromosome doubling and comparative mapping to test whether heterozygous rearrangements directly cause underdominant male sterility in M. lewisii-M. cardinalis hybrids. Consistent with a direct chromosomal basis for hybrid sterility, synthetic tetraploid F1 s showed highly restored fertility (83.4{\%} pollen fertility) relative to diploids F1 s (36.0{\%}). Additional mapping with Mimulus parishii-M. cardinalis and M. parishii-M. lewisii hybrids demonstrated that underdominant male sterility is caused by one M. lewisii specific and one M. cardinalis specific reciprocal translocation, but that inversions had no direct effects on fertility. We discuss the importance of translocations as causes of reproductive isolation, and consider models for how underdominant rearrangements spread and fix despite intrinsic fitness costs.},

We provide evidence of a phenotype-environment association for differential adaptive swimming behaviors through experiments conducted on dwarf, normal, and hybrid lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). Highly significant differences were observed for depth selection, directional changes, and burst swimming, implicating a genetic basis for these behaviors. Hybrid crosses revealed that depth selection is under additive genetic control, while dominance effects were suggested for directional changes and burst swimming. Estimates for the genetic basis of behavioral differentiation from an animal model were consistent with these observations. Comparative estimates of behavioral differentiation (Q(ST)) against neutral expectations (F(ST)) revealed pronounced departures from neutral expectations in all three behavioral phenotypes, consistent with the hypothesis that directional selection has driven the divergence of behavior in dwarf and normal lake whitefish ecotypes.},

abstract = {Herbivores and pollinators can simultaneously exert selective pressures on plant traits via direct and indirect effects. Net selection on plant traits, such as defensive chemistry, may be difficult to predict from studying either of these interactions in isolation. In this study, alkaloids were manipulated experimentally in the hemiparasitic annual plant Castilleja indivisa (Scrophulariaceae; Indian paintbrush) by growing these parasites with bitter (high-alkaloid) or sweet (low-alkaloid) near-isogenic lines of the host Lupinus albus (Fabaceae) in the field. To evaluate the effect of herbivores, half of the Indian paintbrush plants were randomly assigned to a reduced-herbivory treatment using insecticide, and the other half to a natural-herbivory treatment. Floral traits, bud and fruit herbivory, pollination, alkaloids, and plant performance were measured. These variables were used in a path analysis to dissect the direct and indirect effects of herbivory and pollination on lifetime seed set, and the direct and indirect effects of alkaloids on seed set via herbivory and pollination. Bud herbivory and fruit herbivory directly decreased seed production, whereas polli- nation had a direct positive effect. In addition, bud herbivory had negative indirect effects on seed set by reducing the number of open flowers, which reduced pollinator visits. Alkaloids directly reduced bud herbivory but did not significantly affect pollination or fruit herbivory directly. However, because bud herbivory indirectly reduced seed set by reducing pollinator visits to flowers, alkaloids also had additional indirect benefits for plants by increasing pollination. Overall, the net benefit of alkaloid uptake was due to both reduction in herbivory and an increase in pollinator visits to flowers. This study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple interactions simultaneously when attempting to under- stand the mechanisms underlying correlations between plant traits and fitnes},

abstract = {The diversity of life is one of the most striking aspects of our planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts ∼8.7 million (±1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which ∼2.2 million (±0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86{\%} of existing species on Earth and 91{\%} of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

We examined the relationship between urbanization and carotenoid-based plumage color of Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) in 13 riparian forests distributed across a rural-to-urban landscape gradient in central Ohio, USA. Feathers and morphometric measurements were collected from breeding territorial males (n 5 129) and females (n 5 145) during March-August 2006-2008. Plumage brightness of males, but not females, increased with body condition (i.e., size-adjusted mass) and declined with amount of urbanization surrounding forests in which cardinals bred. The extent plumage coloration reflected condition was partially mediated by landscape composition. Specifically, the relationship between brightness and body condition was most pronounced in the most rural landscapes. The interdependency of male coloration and body condition may be more relaxed in urban than rural landscapes if carotenoid-rich foods from anthropogenic and/or invasive sources are more available, or are accessible to birds across a wide range of condition.},

abstract = {Many avian species live, breed, and communicate in urban areas. To survive and reproduce in these areas, birds must transmit their signals to intended receivers. As an arena for acoustic communication, 2 salient features of the urban environment are an abundance of reflective surfaces and a high level of low-frequency anthropogenic noise. Each presents unique communication challenges, with hard surfaces reflecting and distorting high frequencies and noise masking low-frequency song components. Based on this, we predicted that noise level would affect minimum song frequency and urban development (percentage of impervious surface) would affect maximum frequency and frequency range. We compared the effects of urban development and noise on songs of 6 bird species at 28 sites along an urban to rural gradient, across a broad range of noise levels. We found that minimum song frequency increased as noise level increased for 2 of 6 species, with 5 of 6 species showing a strong trend in the predicted direction. Species with lower frequency songs were more affected by noise. Maximum frequency and frequency range decreased for 2 of 6 species as urban development increased, and this effect was stronger for species with higher frequency songs. For some species, minimum frequency only increased with noise at less urban sites and similarly, maximum frequency and frequency range only decreased with urbanization at quiet sites, suggesting a trade-off between different vocal adjustments. Ours is the first study to investigate how noise and urban development affect song frequency characteristics of multiple bird species.},

abstract = {The intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus was used as a model organism to look at effects of crossing distance on fitness and to investigate the genetic mechanisms responsible. Crosses were conducted between 12 pairs of populations spanning a broad range of both geographic distance (5 m to 2007 km) and genetic distance (0.2{\%} to 22.3{\%} sequence divergence for a 606-bp segment of the mitochondrial COI gene). For each pair of populations, three fitness components (hatching number, survivorship number, and metamorphosis number) were measured in up to 16 cohorts including parentals, reciprocal F-1, F-2, F-3, and first-generation backcross hybrids. Comparisons of each set of cohorts allowed estimation of within- and between-locus gene interaction. Relative to parentals, F-1 hybrids showed a trend toward increased fitness, with no correspondence with population divergence, and a decrease in variance, which in some cases correlated with population divergence. In sharp contrast, F-2 hybrids had a decrease in fitness and an increase in variance that both corresponded to population divergence. Genetic interpretation of these patterns suggests that both the beneficial effects of dominance and the detrimental effects of breaking up coadaptation are magnified by increasing evolutionary distance between populations. Because there is no recombination in T. californicus females, effects of recombination can be assessed by comparing F-1 hybrid males and females backcrossed to parentals. Both recombinant and nonrecombinant backcross hybrids showed a decline in fitness correlated with population divergence, indicating that segregation among chromosomes contributes to the breakup of coadaptation. Although there was no difference in mean fitness between the two backcross types, recombinational backcrosses showed greater variance for fitness than nonrecombinational backcrosses, suggesting that the breakup of parental gene ombinations within chromosomes has both beneficial and detrimental effects.},

abstract = {Theory predicts that plant defensive traits are costly due to trade-offs between allocation to defense and growth and reproduction. Most previous studies of costs of plant defense focused on female fitness costs of constitutively expressed defenses. Consideration of alternative plant strategies, such as induced defenses and tolerance to herbivory, and multiple types of costs, including allocation to male reproductive function, may increase our ability to detect costs of plant defense against herbivores. In this study we measured male and female reproductive costs associated with induced responses and tolerance to herbivory in annual wild radish plants (Raphanus raphanistrum). We induced resistance in the plants by subjecting them to herbivory by Pieris rapae caterpillars. We also induced resistance in plants without leaf tissue removal using a natural chemical elicitor, jasmonic acid; in addition, we removed leaf tissue without inducing plant responses using manual clipping. Induced responses included increased concentrations of indole glucosinolates, which are putative defense compounds. Induced responses, in the absence of leaf tissue removal, reduced plant fitness when five fitness components were considered together; costs of induction were individually detected for time to first flower and number of pollen grains produced per flower. In this system, induced responses appear to impose a cost, although this cost may not have been detected had we only quantified the traditionally measured fitness components, growth and seed production. In the absence of induced responses, 50{\%} leaf tissue removal, reduced plant fitness in three out of the five fitness components measured. Induced responses to herbivory and leaf tissue removal had additive effects on plant fitness. Although plant sibships varied greatly (49-136{\%}) in their level of tolerance to herbivory, costs of tolerance were not detected, as we did not find a negative association between the ability to compensate for damage and plant fitness in the absence of damage. We suggest that consideration of alternative plant defense strategies and multiple costs will result in a broader understanding of the evolutionary ecology of plant defense.},

abstract = {Ecologically mediated selection has increasingly become recognised as an important driver of speciation. The correlation between neutral genetic differentiation and environmental or phenotypic divergence among populations, to which we collectively refer to as isolation-by-ecology (IBE), is an indicator of ecological speciation. In a meta-analysis framework, we determined the strength and commonality of IBE in nature. On the basis of 106 studies, we calculated a mean effect size of IBE with and without controlling for spatial autocorrelation among populations. Effect sizes were 0.34 (95{\%} CI 0.24-0.42) and 0.26 (95{\%} CI 0.13-0.37), respectively, indicating that an average of 5{\%} of the neutral genetic differentiation among populations was explained purely by ecological contrast. Importantly, spatial autocorrelation reduced IBE correlations for environmental variables, but not for phenotypes. Through simulation, we showed how the influence of isolation-by-distance and spatial autocorrelation of ecological variables can result in false positives or underestimated correlations if not accounted for in the IBE model. Collectively, this meta-analysis showed that ecologically induced genetic divergence is pervasive across time-scales and taxa, and largely independent of the choice of molecular marker. We discuss the importance of these results in the context of adaptation and ecological speciation and suggest future research avenues.},

abstract = {1. The functional significance of candidate defence mechanisms, including fruit abortion, fruit morphology and seed provisioning of Silene latifolia (Miller) Kraus (Caryophyllaceae), was tested using experimental exposure to its seed predator Hadena bicruris Hufnagel (Noctuidae). This moth lays eggs in S. latifolia female flowers, and each larva consumes three to four fruits to achieve development. Specifically, we sought to explain why fruit walls are thicker in European plants compared with plants in the introduced range where the seed predator is absent, which suggests a defensive role for fruit wall. We also analysed the carbon and nitrogen content of the seeds of exposed and unexposed plants to investigate whether plants respond to moth attack by modifying seed provisioning. 2. Experimental exposure to moth eggs significantly increased fruit abortion. Fruits built after attack on exposed plants did not have significantly thicker fruit walls compared with fruits on control plants. The proportion of N and C within seeds was significantly, but only slightly, modified in exposed plants. 3. Fruits with thicker fruit walls were not significantly less profitable, nor did they require longer handling time when exposed to larvae. 4. Populations varied significantly in fruit wall thickness. When flowers were infested experimentally, we found significant among-family variation in larval growth, suggesting genetic (or maternal environmental) variation. 5. We conclude that fruit abortion is an important defence mechanism. Constitutive investment in fruit wall thickness does not provide a strong protection against secondary attack. Plants do not appear to respond to attack by modifying fruit wall thickness or seed provisioning in later fruits. Future studies may compare fruit abortion and palatability of European and American plants with their greater variation, to address whether relaxed selection away from the seed predator modifies defences to this natural enemy. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {A classic biogeographic pattern is the alignment of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid races of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) across the Chihuahuan, Sonoran and Mohave Deserts of western North America. We used statistically robust differences in guard cell size of modern plants and fossil leaves from packrat middens to map current and past distributions of these ploidy races since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Glacial/early Holocene (26-10 C-14 kyr BP or thousands of radiocarbon years before present) populations included diploids along the lower Rio Grande of west Texas, 650 km removed from sympatric diploids and tetraploids in the lower Colorado River Basin of south-eastern California/ south-western Arizona. Diploids migrated slowly from lower Rio Grande refugia with expansion into the northern Chihuahuan Desert sites forestalled until after similar to4.0 C-14 kyr Bp. Tetraploids expanded from the lower Colorado River Basin into the northern limits of the Sonoran Desert in central Arizona by 6.4 C-14 kyr BP. Hexaploids appeared by 8.5 C-14 kyr BP in the lower Colorado River Basin, reaching their northernmost limits (similar to 37 degreesN) in the Mohave Desert between 5.6 and 3.9 C-14 kyr BP. Modern diploid isolates may have resulted from both vicariant and dispersal events. In central Baja California and the lower Colorado River Basin, modern diploids probably originated from relict populations near glacial refugia. Founder events in the middle and late Holocene established diploid outposts on isolated limestone outcrops in areas of central and southern Arizona dominated by tetraploid populations. Geographic alignment of the three ploidy races along the modern gradient of increasingly drier and hotter summers is clearly a postglacial phenomenon, but evolution of both higher ploidy races must have happened before the Holocene. The exact timing and mechanism of polyploidy evolution in creosote bush remains a matter of conjecture.},

abstract = {Background: Stickleback fishes are an outstanding model for understanding evolution and ecology. Celebrating successes and identifying new questions, the Seventh International Conference on Stickleback Behaviour and Evolution was held 29 July to 3 August 2012 near Seattle, Washington, USA. Questions: How has research on stickleback shaped our understanding of phenotypic variation, genomic variation, speciation, and eco-evolutionary dynamics? How is future research on stickleback likely to advance these topics? Phenotypic variation: Stickleback show exceptional variation at a diversity of spatial scales, which has yielded insights not only into how natural selection shapes evolutionary diversification, but also how the influence of natural selection can be constrained. Future research would profit from examining temporal variation in selection and the multifarious nature of selection. Genomic variation: Stickleback adapted to different environments show widespread, but heterogeneous, genomic differentiation that is often associated with variation in recombination rate and that shows both parallel and non-parallel patterns. Profitable areas for future research include identifying the links between genotype–phenotype–fitness, the processes generating genomic patterns of differentiation, the mechanisms underlying variation in recombination, and the spread of chromosomal inversions. Speciation: Stickleback research has shaped our understanding of ecological speciation, the factors that promote and constrain it, and the traits involved in reproductive isolation. More work is needed in all these areas, as well as in the genomics of speciation and the alternatives to ecological speciation. Eco-evolutionary dynamics: Stickleback adapted to different environments have differential effects on community and ecosystem variables in mesocosms. Future work should investigate the strength and form of these effects in nature, the importance of plastic and genetic contributions, and the nature of feedbacks between ecology and evolution.},

abstract = {This paper applies the biological species concept to two ecologically distinct species of grasshopper, melanoplus sanguinipes and M. devastator, by testing for reproductive isolation in the field in California. Two independent techniques for assessing gene flow between species were employed. Firstly, we examined male genitalic morphology in populations from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada where the two species are parapatric. Two genetically based genitalic traits that differed between allopatric populations of each species formed a dine in this zone. Males captured in the field from the region of parapatry resembled offspring from interspecific laboratory hybridizations. Secondly, we surveyed electrophoretic variation of populations from across California and used F statistics to estimate levels of gene flow within and between species. Results from both morphology and F statistics suggested that these grasshoppers are not reproductively isolated in nature but that gene flow between species is reduced relative to within-species. These field results were consistent with a laboratory study that showed partial but not complete hybrid egg inviability. Because the hybrid zone is centred along an ecological transition, this system offers an opportunity to investigate whether adaptive changes across the zone contribute to reduced gene flow between species.},

abstract = {Urbanization is among the most important and globally rapidly increasing anthropogenic processes and is known to drive rapid evolution. Habitats in urbanized areas typically consist of small, fragmented and isolated patches, which are expected to select for a better locomotor performance, along with its underlying morphological traits. This, in turn, is expected to cause differentiation in selection regimes, as populations with different frequency distributions for a given trait will span different parts of the species' fitness function. Yet, very few studies considered differentiation in phenotypic traits associated with patterns in habitat fragmentation and isolation along urbanization gradients, and none considered differentiation in sexual selection regimes. We investigated differentiation in flight performance and flight-related traits and sexual selection on these traits across replicated urban and rural populations of the scrambling damselfly Coenagrion puella. To disentangle direct and indirect paths going from phenotypic traits over performance to mating success, we applied a path analysis approach. We report for the first time direct evidence for the expected better locomotor performance in urban compared to rural populations. This matches a scenario of spatial sorting, whereby only the individuals with the best locomotor abilities colonize the isolated urban populations. The covariation patterns and causal relationships among the phenotypic traits, performance and mating success strongly depended on the urbanization level. Notably, we detected sexual selection for a higher flight endurance only in urban populations, indicating that the higher flight performance of urban males was reinforced by sexual selection. Taken together, our results provide a unique proof of the interplay between sexual selection and adaptation to human-altered environments.},

abstract = {Divergent natural selection has been shown to promote speciation in a wide range of taxa. For example, adaptation to different ecological environments, via divergent selection, can result in the evolution of reproductive incompatibility between populations. Phytophagous insects have been at the forefront of these investigations of 'ecological speciation' and it is clear that adaptation to different host plants can promote insect speciation. However, much remains unknown. For example, there is abundant variability in the extent to which divergent selection promotes speciation, the sources of divergent selection, the types of reproductive barriers involved, and the genetic basis of divergent adaptation. We review these factors here. Several findings emerge, including the observation that although numerous different sources of divergent selection and reproductive isolation can be involved in insect speciation, their order of evolution and relative importance are poorly understood. Another finding is that the genetic basis of host preference and performance can involve loci of major effect and opposing dominance, factors which might facilitate speciation in the face of gene flow. In addition, we raise a number of other recent issues relating to phytophagous insect speciation, such as alternatives to ecological speciation, the geography of speciation, and the molecular signatures of speciation. Throughout, we aim to both synthesize what is known, as well as highlight areas where future work is especially needed.},

abstract = {The recurrent evolution of adaptive clines within a species can be used to elucidate the selective factors and genetic responses that underlie adaptation. White clover is polymorphic for cyanogenesis (HCN release with tissue damage), and climate-associated cyanogenesis clines have evolved throughout the native and introduced species range. This polymorphism arises through two independently segregating Mendelian polymorphisms for the presence/absence of two required components: cyanogenic glucosides and their hydrolyzing enzyme linamarase. Cyanogenesis is commonly thought to function in herbivore defense; however, the individual cyanogenic components may also serve other physiological functions. To test whether cyanogenesis clines have evolved in response to the same selective pressures acting on the same genetic targets, we examined cyanogenesis cline shape and its environmental correlates in three world regions: southern New Zealand, the central United States and the US Pacific Northwest. For some regional comparisons, cline shapes are remarkably similar despite large differences in the spatial scales over which clines occur (40-1600 km). However, we also find evidence for major differences in both the agents and targets of selection among the sampled clines. Variation in cyanogenesis frequency is best predicted using a combination of minimum winter temperature and aridity variables. Together, our results provide evidence that recurrent adaptive clines do not necessarily reflect shared adaptive processes.},

To survive, the population must adapt before it goes extinct. Such “evolutionary rescue” is characterized by a U-shaped curve: population size declines and then recovers as a beneficial allele increases in number. Here we describe this U-shaped curve mathematically when the rescuing allele starts out rare. We obtain several results. First, we calculate when evolutionary rescue is more likely to come from new mutation than from the standing genetic variation. Second, by describing the entire U-shaped curve mathematically, we derive the time until the average rescued population begins to rebound in size as well as the smallest average population size experienced before rescue. We also find that evolutionary rescue from new mutation takes longer and involves a smaller minimum population size than rescue from the standing genetic variation.},

abstract = {This paper analyses, on an individual plant basis, the various components determining seed production in the evergreen shrub Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae), in order to estimate their relative contributions to individual differences in fecundity. The rela- tionships between fecundity and age, size, and growth rate are also examined. Experimental pollination and watering were done in an attempt to alter natural patterns of partial fe- cundity components. Fecundity of individual plants is partitioned into its absolute (number of inflorescences, number of flowers per inflorescence) and relative (fruits/flower and seeds/ fruit) partial components, and the following questions are addressed: (1) Are there indi- vidual differences in relative components of fecundity? (2) What are the proportional contributions of relative and absolute components of fecundity to individual variation in seed production? (3) Are relative measures of reproductive success reliable predictors of individual differences in fecundity? (4) When induced experimentally, do changes in partial fecundity components translate into modifications of the population's ranking of absolute fecundities? Fecundity depended more on plant size than age, was unrelated to growth rate, and was limited by water, but not pollen, availability. Individual plants differed in all components of fecundity examined, and differences were consistent among years. The proportional contributions of the various components to individual differences in fecundity were very unequal. Almost all variation among plants in seed production (-90{\%} of variance) was explained by the variances and covariances of number of inflorescences and number of flowers per inflorescence. Variation among plants in the two relative components (fruit and seed set), even though statistically significant, had a negligible influence on individual differences in fecundity. These patterns remained invariant despite significant modification of flower production and fruit set induced by artificially watering a part of the study population. Fruit and seed set alone are unreliable indicators of individual differences in the maternal component of fitness in L. latifolia, and a review of relevant literature indicates that this probably applies to other polycarpic plants as well. Plant reproductive biology studies may make erroneous inferences if they consider exclusively data on relative fruit and seed set, and neglect the absolute components of individual differences in fecundity. It is proposed that, to circumvent these potential problems, demographic aspects and absolute estimates of seed output on a per individual basis should be examined in addition to the customarily employed fruit and seed set measures.},

abstract = {Urban areas are among the most heavily managed landscapes in the world, yet they harbor a remarkable richness of species. Private yards are common habitats in urban areas and are places where cultivated species manage to escape cultivation and become part of the spontaneous species pool. Yards are novel ecosystems where community assembly is driven by both natural and anthropogenic processes. Phylogenetic diversity and functional traits are increasingly recognized as critical to understanding processes of community assembly. Recent evidence indicates that urban areas may select more closely related plant species from the pool of regionally occurring species than do nonurban areas, and that exotic species are phylogenetically clustered within communities. We tested whether phylogenetic diversity and functional trait composition in privately managed yards change along a gradient of housing density in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolis, Minnesota, USA, in accordance with these predictions. We also identified characteristics of the spontaneous yard flora by comparing its phylogenetic diversity and functional composition with the ‘‘natural-areas'' species pool represented by the flora of nearby Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. Along the urbanization gradient, yards had more species per hectare in densely built regions than in lower-density regions, but phylogenetic diversity and functional composition did not change with housing density. In contrast, in comparison to species in natural areas, yard species were more closely related to each other and functionally distinct: They were more often short-lived, self-compatible, and had higher specific leaf area than species of Cedar Creek. The high number of exotic yard species increased the yard flora's phylogenetic relatedness in comparison to species of Cedar Creek, causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners' preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries, their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in comparison to species of Cedar Creek, causing a degree of phylogenetic homogenization within yards. The urban environment and homeowners' preferences select for trait attributes and phylogenetic lineages that can colonize and persist in yards. As yard species disperse beyond household boundaries, their functional attributes will affect ecosystem processes in urban environments and beyond, such as accelerating decomposition rates. Limited phylogenetic diversity may reduce the potential of ecosystems to respond to environmental changes. As cities continue to expand globally, understanding the impacts of yard management for biodiversity and ecosystem services becomes increasingly important.},

abstract = {Multiple-species floral displays have been hypothesized to facilitate pollination by attracting a greater number and/or diversity of pollinators. Here I present experimental confirmation of pollination facilitation among coflowering plants that have morphologically distinct flowers. Pollinator visits to Raphanus raphanistrum, a self-incompatible herbaceous plant, increased when it occurred with one or a combination of Cirsium arvense, Hypericum perforatum and Solidago canadensis than when it occurred alone. Enhanced visitation to R. raphanistrum in mixed species plots was reflected by increased seed production. Facilitative effects in pollination were conditional on the density and evenness of the floral mixture and graded into competition as the relative abundance of R. raphanistrum declined in a two-species mixture. Previously proposed mechanisms for facilitative interactions cannot explain facilitation among florally distinct plant displays. An alternative mechanism of differential but complementary floral rewards is proposed to explain facilitative attraction of pollinators. Facilitation of, and competition for, pollination has implications for regeneration by seed of rare or isolated plants, and of mitigating Allee effects that afflict such populations.},

Recent studies of hybridization have shown that extreme (e.g. transgressive) phenotypes can be generated during massive genetic recombination events such as interspecific hybridization. Extreme hybrid phenotypes appear to have the potential to create new lineages and lead to evolutionary divergence. 2. Hybrid genotypes of some salt marsh species have proven capable of reengineering their ecosystems, while in other cases, hybridization has transformed plant communities by facilitating species invasion. 3. Using the Louisiana irises, a naturally hybridizing group of species, we assessed the potential for hybrids of Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva to possess extreme physiological and growth traits. Our glasshouse experiment used two soil water environments (wet and flood) to measure hybrid trait expression at both the genotypic class and individual genotype level. 4. At the genotypic class level, two of the three hybrid classes (F(1)s, and backcrosses towards each parental species) were transgressive for at least one physiological trait (F(1)s for root mass proportion, specific leaf area and final leaf area; backcrosses to I. brevicaulis for leaf area ratio). Three fitness components (total biomass, ramet production and flower production) were measured on each plant in the experiment. All three hybrid classes had greater clonal fitness (total biomass) but not greater sexual fitness (flower number) than parent species. 5. At the individual genotype level, two F-1 hybrids showed extreme physiological trait expression: one for specific leaf area, and the other for shallow root allocation. Flower production was the only fitness component that showed some degree of environment-dependence at the individual genotype level. 6. Although early generation hybrid classes can contain rare genotypes with extreme phenotypic trait expression, and hybrid fitness components were equal or superior to both parental species in most cases, there was not a strong association between transgressive traits and elevated hybrid fitness.},

Here, we investigated the effects of foliar herbivory by two herbivore species on defense compounds, floral signaling, pollinator and parasitoid attraction, and seed production. Herbivory generally reduced the quantity of many floral volatile organic compounds VOCs) in Brassica rapa. By contrast, floral color, flower diameter, and plant height remained unaffected. The decreased amounts of floral volatiles led to reduced attractiveness of flowers to pollinators, but increased the attractiveness of herbivore-infested plants to parasitoids. Plants infested with the native butterfly Pieris brassicae produced more flowers during early flowering, effectively compensating for the lower olfactory attractiveness. Herbivory by the invasive Spodoptera littoralis increased the amounts of glucobrassicanapin, and led to delayed flowering. These plants tended to attract fewer pollinators and to produce fewer seeds. Our study indicates a tradeoff between pollinator attraction and indirect defense (parasitoid attraction), which can be mitigated by reduced floral VOC emission and production of more early flowers. We suggest that this compensatory mechanism is specific to plant-herbivore associations with a coevolutionary history.},

abstract = {Studying the genetic architecture of sexual traits provides insight into the rate and direction at which traits can respond to selection. Traits associated with few loci and limited genetic and phenotypic constraints tend to evolve at high rates typically observed for secondary sexual characters. Here, we examined the genetic architecture of song traits and female song preferences in the field crickets Gryllus rubens and Gryllus texensis. Song and preference data were collected from both species and interspecific F1 and F2 hybrids. We first analysed phenotypic variation to examine interspecific differentiation and trait distributions in parental and hybrid generations. Then, the relative contribution of additive and additive-dominance variation was estimated. Finally, phenotypic variance–covariance (P) matrices were estimated to evaluate the multivariate phenotype available for selection. Song traits and preferences had unimodal trait distributions, and hybrid offspring were intermediate with respect to the parents. We uncovered additive and dominance variation in song traits and preferences. For two song traits, we found evidence for X-linked inheritance. On the one hand, the observed genetic architecture does not suggest rapid divergence, although sex linkage may have allowed for somewhat higher evolutionary rates. On the other hand, P matrices revealed that multivariate variation in song traits aligned with major dimensions in song preferences, suggesting a strong selection response. We also found strong covariance between the main traits that are sexually selected and traits that are not directly selected by females, providing an explanation for the striking multivariate divergence in male calling songs despite limited divergence in female preferences. },

abstract = {Urbanization may affect genetic differentiation among animal populations because it converts native vege- tation to novel land cover types that can affect population connectivity. The effect of land cover change on genetic differentiation may vary among taxa; mobile birds may be least affected. Regardless, genetic differentiation between populations should be best predicted by measures of dis- tance that incorporate the effect of land cover on move- ment. We studied the relationship between land cover and genetic differentiation in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) at eighteen sites in the Seattle metropolitan region. We generated a series of hypothetical ‘‘resistance surfaces'' based on land cover and development age, cal- culated ‘‘resistance distances'' between pairs of sampling sites, and related them to pairwise genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation was best described by a multiple regression model where resistance to gene flow (1) linearly increased with age of development and (2) was greater in high- and medium-density urbanization than in native forest land cover types (R2 = 0.15; p = 0.003). The single variable with the highest correlation with genetic differ- entiation was derived from a linear relationship between development age and resistance (R2 = 0.08; p = 0.007). Our results thus suggested that urban development reduced population connectivity for Song Sparrows. However, the relation of development age to genetic differentiation suggested that equilibrium was not yet reached. Hence, the effects of lost connectivity will increase. Our understand- ing of the landscape genetics of this recently anthropo- genically modified landscape benefited from considering population history. Keywords},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hypothesis that pollinators have been important drivers of angiosperm diversity dates back to Darwin, and remains an important research topic today. Mounting evidence indicates that pollinators have the potential to drive diversification at several different stages of the evolutionary process. Microevolutionary studies have provided evidence for pollinator-mediated floral adaptation, while macroevolutionary evidence supports a general pattern of pollinator-driven diversification of angiosperms. However, the overarching issue of whether, and how, shifts in pollination system drive plant speciation represents a critical gap in knowledge. Bridging this gap is crucial to fully understand whether pollinator-driven microevolution accounts for the observed macroevolutionary patterns. Testable predictions about pollinator-driven speciation can be derived from the theory of ecological speciation, according to which adaptation (microevolution) and speciation (macroevolution) are directly linked. This theory is a particularly suitable framework for evaluating evidence for the processes underlying shifts in pollination systems and their potential consequences for the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation. SCOPE: This Viewpoint paper focuses on evidence for the four components of ecological speciation in the context of plant-pollinator interactions, namely (1) the role of pollinators as selective agents, (2) floral trait divergence, including the evolution of 'pollination ecotypes', (3) the geographical context of selection on floral traits, and (4) the role of pollinators in the evolution of reproductive isolation. This Viewpoint also serves as the introduction to a Special Issue on Pollinator-Driven Speciation in Plants. The 13 papers in this Special Issue range from microevolutionary studies of ecotypes to macroevolutionary studies of historical ecological shifts, and span a wide range of geographical areas and plant families. These studies further illustrate innovative experimental approaches, and they employ modern tools in genetics and floral trait quantification. Future advances to the field require better quantification of selection through male fitness and pollinator isolation, for instance by exploiting next-generation sequencing technologies. By combining these new tools with strategically chosen study systems, and smart experimental design, we predict that examples of pollinator-driven speciation will be among the most widespread and compelling of all cases of ecological speciation.},

abstract = {White clover (Trifolium repens) is naturally polymorphic for cyanogenesis (hydrogen cyanide release following tissue damage). The ecological factors favouring cyanogenic and acyanogenic plants have been examined in numerous studies over the last half century, making this one of the best-documented examples of an adaptive polymorphism in plants. White clover cyanogenesis is controlled by two, independently segregating Mendelian genes: Ac/ac controls the presence/absence of cyanogenic glucosides; and Li/li controls the presence/absence of their hydrolysing enzyme, linamarase. In this study, we examine the molecular evolution and population genetics of Li as it relates to the cyanogenesis polymorphism. We report here that Li exists as a single-copy gene in plants possessing linamarase activity, and that the absence of enzyme activity in li/li plants is correlated with the absence of much or all of the gene from the white clover genome. Consistent with this finding, we confirm by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction that Li gene expression is absent in plants lacking enzyme activity. In a molecular population genetic analysis of Li and three unlinked genes using a worldwide sample of clover plants, we find an absence of nucleotide variation and statistically significant deviations from neutrality at Li; these findings are consistent with recent positive directional selection at this cyanogenesis locus.},

abstract = {(+/-)-Catechin is a flavan-3-ol that occurs in the organs of many plant species, especially fruits. Health-beneficial effects have been studied extensively, and notable toxic effects have not been found. In contrast, (+/-)-catechin has been implicated as a 'chemical weapon' that is exuded by the roots of Centaurea stoebe, an invasive knapweed of northern America. Recently, this hypothesis has been rejected based on (+/-)-catechin's low phytotoxicity, instability at pH levels higher than 5, and poor recovery from soil. In the current study, (+/-)-catechin did not inhibit the development of white and black mustard to an extent that was comparable to the highly phytotoxic juglone, a naphthoquinone that is allegedly responsible for the allelopathy of the walnut tree. At high stress levels, caused by sub-lethal methanol concentrations in the medium, and a 12 h photoperiod, (+/-)-catechin even attenuated growth retardation. A similar effect was observed when (+/-)-catechin was assayed for brine shrimp mortality. Higher concentrations reduced the mortality caused by toxic concentrations of methanol. Further, when (+/-)-catechin was tested in variants of the deoxyribose degradation assay, it was an efficient scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when they were present in higher concentrations. This antioxidant effect was enhanced when iron was chelated directly by (+/-)-catechin. Conversely, if iron was chelated to EDTA, pro-oxidative effects were demonstrated at higher concentrations; in this case (+/-)-catechin reduced molecular oxygen and iron to reagents required by the Fenton reaction to produce hydroxyl radicals. A comparison of cyclic voltammograms of (+/-)-catechin with the phytotoxic naphthoquinone juglone indicated similar redox-cycling properties for both compounds although juglone required lower electrochemical potentials to enter redox reactions. In buffer solutions, (+/-)-catechin remained stable at pH 3.6 (vacuole) and decomposed at pH 7.4 (cytoplasm) after 24 h. The results support the recent rejection of the hypothesis that (+/-)-catechin may serve as a 'chemical weapon' for invasive plants. Instead, accumulation and exudation of (+/-)-catechin may help plants survive periods of stress.},

abstract = {The interplay between selection and aspects of the genetic architecture of traits (such as linkage, dominance, and epistasis) can either drive or constrain speciation [1-3]. Despite accumulating evidence that speciation can progress to "intermediate" stages - with populations evolving only partial reproductive isolation - studies describing selective mechanisms that impose constraints on speciation are more rare than those describing drivers. The stick insect Timema cristinae provides an example of a system in which partial reproductive isolation has evolved between populations adapted to different host plant environments, in part due to divergent selection acting on a pattern polymorphism [4, 5]. Here, we demonstrate how selection on a green/melanistic color polymorphism counteracts speciation in this system. Specifically, divergent selection between hosts does not occur on color phenotypes because melanistic T. cristinae are cryptic on the stems of both host species, are resistant to a fungal pathogen, and have a mating advantage. Using genetic crosses and genome-wide association mapping, we quantify the genetic architecture of both the pattern and color polymorphism, illustrating their simple genetic control. We use these empirical results to develop an individual-based model that shows how the melanistic phenotype acts as a "genetic bridge" that increases gene flow between populations living on different hosts. Our results demonstrate how variation in the nature of selection acting on traits, and aspects of trait genetic architecture, can impose constraints on both local adaptation and speciation.},

abstract = {Speciation in herbivorous insects has received considerable attention during the last few decades. Much of this group's diversity originates from adaptive population divergence onto different host plants, which often involves the evolution of specialized patterns of host choice behaviour. Differences in host choice often translates directly into divergence in mating sites, and therefore positive assortative mating will be created which will act as a strong barrier to gene flow. In this study, we first explored whether host choice is a genetically determined trait in the sympatric willow and birch host races of the leaf feeding beetle Lochmaea capreae, or whether larval experience influences adult host choice. Once we had established that host choice is a genetically based trait we determined its genetic architecture. To achieve this, we employed a reciprocal transplant design in which offspring from pure willow and birch cross-types, F1, F2 and backcrosses were raised on each host plant and their preference was determined upon reaching adulthood. We then applied joint-scaling analysis to uncover the genetic architecture of host preference. Our results suggest that rearing host does not have a pronounced effect on adult's host choice; rather the segregation pattern implies the existence of genetic loci affecting host choice in these host races. The joint-scaling analysis revealed that population differences in host choice are mainly influenced by the contribution of additive genetic effects and also maternally inherited cytoplasmic effects.

abstract = {This paper compares the performance of five modelling methods in the prediction of a species distribution, using a data set describing the distribution of the threatened clouded apollo butterfly (Parnassius mnemosyne) in south-west Finland. The five statistical techniques included were: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), classification tree analysis (CTA), neural networks (ANN) and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS). The accuracy of the models was examined at three spatial resolutions (1, 25 and 100 ha) by area under the curve (AUC) and kappa statistics. All five modelling techniques had a relatively high discrimination capacity for the occurrence of clouded apollo. Classification tree analysis provided the least robust model performance. The differences between the other methods were small, although GAM and MARS provided marginally the best stability and performance. The most accurate models were developed for the resolutions of 1 ha (highest AUC values) and 25 ha (highest kappa values) and the least accurate models for the resolution of 100 ha. Our work shows that modern modelling techniques can provide useful forecasts of species distributions in unsurveyed parts of landscapes and provide valuable contributions to conservation and management planning. However, the success of applying the new modelling tools can be influenced by the choice of statistical technique and especially of spatial resolution. In conclusion, small changes in the spatial scale may result in a clear decrease in the model performance and thus caution should be exercised when implementing the models and their predictions in practice. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Gene flow between populations that are adapting to distinct environments may be restricted if hybrids inherit maladaptive, intermediate phenotypes. This phenomenon, called extrinsic postzygotic isolation (EPI), is thought to play a critical role in the early stages of speciation. However, despite its intuitive appeal, we know surprisingly little about the strength and prevalence of EPI in nature, and even less about the specific phenotypes that tend to cause problems for hybrids. In this study, we searched for EPI among allopatric populations of the butterfly Euphydryas editha that have specialized on alternative host plants. These populations recall a situation thought typical of the very early stages of speciation. They lack consistent host-associated genetic differentiation at random nuclear loci and show no signs of reproductive incompatibility in the laboratory. However, they do differ consistently in diverse host-related traits. For each of these traits, we first asked whether hybrids between populations that use different hosts (different-host hybrids) were intermediate to parental populations and to hybrids between populations that use the same host (same-host hybrids). We then conducted field experiments to estimate the effects of intermediacy on fitness in nature. Our results revealed strong EPI under field conditions. Different-host hybrids exhibited an array of intermediate traits that were significantly maladaptive, including four behaviors. Intermediate foraging height slowed the growth of larvae, while intermediate oviposition preference, oviposition site height, and clutch size severely reduced the growth and survival of the offspring of adult females. We used our empirical data to construct a fitness surface on which different-host hybrids can be seen to fall in an adaptive valley between two peaks occupied by same-host hybrids. These findings demonstrate how ecological selection against hybrids can create a strong barrier to gene flow at the early stages of adaptive divergence.},

Overall, cytogenetic traits (karyological analysis and estimation of cellular DNA contents using flow cytometry) of hybrid flounder were intermediate between the two parental species. Microsatellite assay was used to distinguish the parental genomes in the hybrids; in most cases, one allele was specific to each of the parents. Morphometrics assessed by body proportions indicated that hybrids generally displayed a morphology intermediate between the maternal and paternal species. Interspecific hybrids exhibited abnormal and retarded gonad development in both sexes based on histological analysis of gonads from adult fish. The sterility of the hybrids presents a significant advantage for their use in aquaculture, as potential escapees would not be capable of reproducing in the wild and contaminating natural stocks.},

abstract = {Ray-finned fishes make up half of all living vertebrate species. Nearly all ray-finned fishes are teleosts, which include most commercially important fish species, several model organisms for genomics and developmental biology, and the dominant component of marine and freshwater vertebrate faunas. Despite the economic and scientific importance of ray-finned fishes, the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny with corresponding divergence-time estimates has limited our understanding of the evolution and diversification of this radiation. Our analyses, which use multiple nuclear gene sequences in conjunction with 36 fossil age constraints, result in a well-supported phylogeny of all major ray-finned fish lineages and molecular age estimates that are generally consistent with the fossil record. This phylogeny informs three long-standing problems: specifically identifying elopomorphs (eels and tarpons) as the sister lineage of all other teleosts, providing a unique hypothesis on the radiation of early euteleosts, and offering a promising strategy for resolution of the "bush at the top of the tree" that includes percomorphs and other spiny-finned teleosts. Contrasting our divergence time estimates with studies using a single nuclear gene or whole mitochondrial genomes, we find that the former underestimates ages of the oldest ray-finned fish divergences, but the latter dramatically overestimates ages for derived teleost lineages. Our time-calibrated phylogeny reveals that much of the diversification leading to extant groups of teleosts occurred between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, identifying this period as the "Second Age of Fishes."},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals commonly prefer certain trait values over others when choosing their mates. If such preferences diverge between populations, they can generate behavioral reproductive isolation and thereby contribute to speciation. Reproductive isolation in insects often involves chemical communication, and cuticular hydrocarbons, in particular, serve as mate recognition signals in many species. We combined data on female cuticular hydrocarbons, interspecific mating propensity, and phylogenetics to evaluate the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in diversification of Timema walking-sticks. RESULTS: Hydrocarbon profiles differed substantially among the nine analyzed species, as well as between partially reproductively-isolated T. cristinae populations adapted to different host plants. In no-choice trials, mating was more likely between species with similar than divergent hydrocarbon profiles, even after correcting for genetic divergences. The macroevolution of hydrocarbon profiles, along a Timema species phylogeny, fits best with a punctuated model of phenotypic change concentrated around speciation events, consistent with change driven by selection during the evolution of reproductive isolation. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our data indicate that cuticular hydrocarbon profiles vary among Timema species and populations, and that most evolutionary change in hydrocarbon profiles occurs in association with speciation events. Similarities in hydrocarbon profiles between species are correlated with interspecific mating propensities, suggesting a role for cuticular hydrocarbon profiles in mate choice and speciation in the genus Timema.},

abstract = {The concept and practice of DNA barcoding have been designed as a system to facilitate species identification and recognition. The primary challenge for barcoding plants has been to identify a suitable region on which to focus the effort. The slow relative nucleotide substitution rates of plant mitochondria and the technical issues with the use of nuclear regions have focused attention on several proposed regions in the plastid genome. One of the challenges for barcoding is to discriminate closely related or recently evolved species. The Myristicaceae, or nutmeg family, is an older group within the angiosperms that contains some recently evolved species providing a challenging test for barcoding plants. The goal of this study is to determine the relative utility of six coding (Universal Plastid Amplicon - UPA, rpoB, rpoc1, accD, rbcL, matK) and one noncoding (trnH-psbA) chloroplast loci for barcoding in the genus Compsoneura using both single region and multiregion approaches. Five of the regions we tested were predominantly invariant across species (UPA, rpoB, rpoC1, accD, rbcL). Two of the regions (matK and trnH-psbA) had significant variation and show promise for barcoding in nutmegs. We demonstrate that a two-gene approach utilizing a moderately variable region (matK) and a more variable region (trnH-psbA) provides resolution among all the Compsonuera species we sampled including the recently evolved C. sprucei and C. mexicana. Our classification analyses based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination, suggest that the use of two regions results in a decreased range of intraspecific variation relative to the distribution of interspecific divergence with 95{\%} of the samples correctly identified in a sequence identification analysis.},

We hypothesized that antiherbivore defenses could alter selection on reproductive traits by altering trait expression through allocation trade-offs, or by altering interactions with mutualists and/or antagonists. Totest our hypothesis,weused white clover, Trifolium repens, which has a Mendelian polymorphism for the production of hydrogen cyanide—a potent antiherbivore defense.We conducted a common garden experiment with 185 clonal families of T. repens that included cyanogenic and acyanogenic genotypes. We quantified resistance to herbivores, and selection on six floral traits and phenology viamale and female fitness. Cyanogenesis reduced herbivory but did not alter the expression of reproductive traits through allocation trade-offs. However, the presence of cyanogenic defenses altered natural selection on petal morphology and the number of flowers within inflorescences via female fitness. Herbivory influenced selection on flowers and phenology via female fitness independently of cyanogenesis. Our results demonstrate that both herbivory and antiherbivore defenses alter natural selection on plant reproductive traits. We discuss the significance of these results for understanding how antiherbivore defenses interact with herbivores and pollinators to shape floral evolution.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that true fruit flies in the Rhagoletis pomonella species group speciate sympatrically (that is, in the absence of geographic isolation) as a consequence of shifts to previously unexploited host plants1,2. Because Rhagoletis larvae are host-specific fruit parasites and mate selection in these flies is directly coupled to host-plant recognition3–5, variation for larval survivorship and host preference traits can act as genetically based barriers to gene flow. This reduction in gene flow results in the sympatric divergence of fly populations adapted to alternative hosts. The shift of R. pomonella from its native host hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) to domestic apples (Mains pumila) in eastern North America in the past 200 years6 provides an opportunity to determine whether host specialization is sufficient to differentiate populations without earlier periods of geographic isolation. We report finding genetic differentiation between co-occurring hawthorn and apple populations of R. pomonella at a field site near Grant, Michigan. The result confirms that hawthorn and apple flies represent partially reproductively isolated 'host races' and is consistent with a sympatric mode of divergence for these flies.},

abstract = {Genetic variances and correlations lie at the center of quantitative evolutionary theory. They are often difficult to estimate, however, due to the large samples of related individuals that are required. I investigated the relationship of genetic- and phenotypic-correlation magnitudes and patterns in 41 pairs of matrices drawn from the literature in order to determine their degree of similarity and whether phenotypic parameters could be used in place of their genetic counterparts in situations where genetic variances and correlations cannot be precisely estimated. The analysis indicates that square genetic correlations were on average much higher than squared phenotypic correlations and that genetic and phenotypic correlations had only broadly similar patterns. These results could be due either to biological causes or to imprecision of genetic-correlation estimates due to sampling error. When only those studies based on the largest sample sizes (effective sample size of 40 or more) were included, squared genetic-correlation estimates were only slightly greater than their phenotypic counterparts and the patterns of correlation were strikingly similar. Thus, much of the dissimilarity between phenotypic- and genetic-correlation estimates seems to be due to imprecise estimates of genetic correlations. Phenotypic correlations are likely to be fair estimates of their genetic counterparts in many situations. These further results also indicate that genetic and environmental causes of phenotypic variation tend to act on growth and development in a similar manner},

abstract = {The existing literature on heat diffusion through a snow-covered land surface deals primarily with snow cover presence or duration; however, the insulation property of a snowpack can vary substantially owing to the changes in snow thickness. Using SNTHERM, a one-dimensional snowpack energy and mass balance model, we have isolated the heat diffusion response to varying initial snow depths, including snow-free conditions, and assessed the magnitude of associated temperature and insulative energy flux anomalies within the entire snowpack-soil column system. A clear and substantial land surface insulative response to snow depth is identified over hourly, intraseasonal, and interannual time scales. The overall snow-soil system warms with increasing snow depth, but the surface snow layer cools slightly, generating decreased ground heat flux and increased sensible heat flux responses. This land surface thermal response is attributable to the increased insulative capacity of deeper snowpacks, which makes the underlying soil less responsive to solar radiation and air temperature fluctuations, and facilitates sustained warming by the bottom soil layer boundary. Furthermore, the overall effect of increasing snow depth due to insulation is comparable in magnitude to the effect of snow presence versus snow absence due to albedo.},

abstract = {Secondary compounds may benefit plants by deterring herbivores, but the presence of these defensive chemicals in floral nectar may also deter beneficial pollinators. This trade-off between sexual reproduction and defense has received minimal study. We determined whether the pollinator-deterring effects of a nectar alkaloid found in the perennial vine Gelsemium sempervirens depend on ecological context (i.e. the availability of alternative nectar sources) by monitoring the behavioural response of captive bumblebees (Bombus impatiens, an important pollinator of G. sempervirens in nature) to nectar alkaloids in several ecologically relevant scenarios. Although alkaloids in floral nectar tended to deter visitation by bumblebees, the magnitude of that effect depended greatly on the availability and nectar properties of alternative flowers. Ecological context should thus be considered when assessing ecological costs of plant defense in terms of pollination services. We consider adaptive strategies that would enable plants to minimize pollinator deterrence because of defensive compounds in flowers.},

abstract = {Over the past 3 centuries, many species have been dispersed beyond their natural geographic limits by humans, but to our knowledge, reproductive isolation has not been demonstrated for such neo-allopatric species. We grew seeds from three species of Centaurea (Centaurea solstitialis, Centaurea calcitrapa, and Centaurea sulphurea) that are native to Spain and have been introduced into California, and we tested to what extent seed production was affected by pollen source. Compared with within-population crosses, seed production decreased by 52{\%} and 44{\%}, respectively, when C. solstitialis and C. sulphurea from California were pollinated with conspecific pollen from native populations in Spain. This implies rapid evolution of reproductive isolation between populations in their native and nonnative ranges. Whether reproductive isolation has evolved following the introduction of other species is unknown, but additional cases are likely, considering the large number of neo-allopatric species.},

abstract = {Reproductive barriers play a major role in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity by restricting gene flow between species. Although both pre- and postzygotic barriers often isolate species, prezygotic barriers are thought to contribute more to reproductive isolation. We investigated possible reproductive barriers between Leavenworthia alabamica and L. crassa, parapatric species with high morphological and ecological similarity and the ability to hybridize. Using greenhouse and field experiments, we tested for habitat isolation and genetic incompatibilities. From controlled crosses, we identified unilateral incompatibility (a partial prezygotic barrier associated with the self-incompatibility system), but no evidence of other genetic incompatibilities. We found a small reduction in pollen viability of F(1) hybrids and early germination of F(1), F(2), and BC hybrids relative to L. alabamica and L. crassa in a common garden experiment, but the effect on fitness was not tested. Field studies of hybrid pollen viability and germination are needed to determine if they contribute to reproductive isolation. In a reciprocal transplant, we found no evidence of habitat isolation or reduced hybrid survival (from seedling to adult stage) or reproduction. These data suggest unilateral incompatibility partially reproductively isolates L. alabamica and L. crassa, but no other reproductive barriers could be detected.},

abstract = {Genetic differentiation in ecological traits plays an important role in the reproductive isolation of phytophagous insects. The present study aims to elucidate the genetic changes involved during the process of host shifts, by combining analyses for (1) host adaptations, (2) pre- and postmating isolation, and (3) phylogeney among populations, using a leaf-mining moth, Acrocercops transecta. This species is associated with Juglans ailanthifolia and Lyonia ovalifolia. Transplantation of the larvae demonstrated that the Juglans-associated population completely failed to survive on Lyonia, whereas the Lyonia-associated population survived on Juglans as well as on Lyonia. Females of respective host-associated populations oviposited on their natal host plant only. An mtDNA-based phylogeny clearly separated the Lyonia-associated population from the Juglandaceae-associated population, and indicated that the Lyonia-associated population once evolved from the Juglandaceae-associated population. These results indicate that the processes of host shifting from juglandaceous species to Lyonia involved genetic changes both in larval ability to use host plants and in host preference of females. The derived Lyonia-associated population has retained the potential to assimilate the ancestral host, Juglandaceae. Mating between the two host-associated populations was successful for both directions of crossing, and there were no significant differences in egg hatchability between hybrids and control crosses. No adults emerged when the F1 hybrid larvae were maintained on Lyonia; however, on Juglans the F1 hybrid larvae grew to adulthood as well as in the control, suggesting a lack of genomic incompatibilities between the two host-associated populations. In conclusion, the results showed that the two host-associated populations are host races that are partially reproductively isolated, and that the differences in performance and preference function as strong barriers against gene flow between the host races.  {\textcopyright} 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 93, 1352013145.},

abstract = {Natural hybrid zones have proven to be precious tools for understanding the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation (RI) and therefore species. Most available genomic studies of hybrid zones using whole or partial genome resequencing approaches have focused on comparisons of the parental source populations involved in genome admixture, rather than exploring fine-scale patterns of chromosomal ancestry across the full admixture gradient present between hybridizing species. We have studied three well-known European 'replicate' hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula, two wide-spread, ecologically divergent forest trees, using up to 432 505 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Estimates of fine-scale chromosomal ancestry, genomic divergence, and differentiation across all 19 poplar chromosomes revealed strikingly contrasting results, including an unexpected preponderance of F1 hybrids in the centre of genomic clines on the one hand, and genomically localized, spatially variable shared variants consistent with ancient introgression between the parental species on the other. Genetic ancestry had a significant effect on survivorship of hybrid seedlings in a common garden trial, pointing to selection against early-generation recombinants. Our results indicate a role for selection against recombinant genotypes in maintaining RI in the face of apparent F1 fertility, consistent with the intra-genomic 'coadaptation' model of barriers to introgression upon secondary contact. Whole genome resequencing of hybridizing populations will clarify the roles of specific genetic pathways in RI between these model forest trees and may reveal which loci are affected most strongly by its cyclic breakdown.

Nevertheless, anthropogenic habitat fragmentation may be fatal to metapopulations, as it disrupts dispersal and gene flow, and undermines the balance between population extinction and colonization. Understanding the extent to which particular land-use practices disrupt dispersal and gene flow is therefore crucial for conserving metapopulations. We examined the structure and fragmentation of metapopulations of the endangered growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) in an urbanizing landscape in southern Australia. Population clustering analyses revealed three distinct genetic units, corresponding to the three wetland clusters sampled. Isolation-by-distance was apparent between populations, and genetic distance was significantly correlated with the presence of urban barriers between populations. Our study provides evidence that urbanization fragments metapopulations of L. raniformis. Managers of L. raniformis in urbanizing landscapes should seek to mitigate effects of urbanization on dispersal and gene flow.},

abstract = {The urbanization of the natural landscape has spread along the major axis of all large towns worldwide, what has resulted in an unprecedented increase in habitat fragmentation and ultimately in a mosaic of patches of native vegetation. These changes have a continuum of impacts on the processes and mechanisms that shape habitat diversity and species interactions. An important and overlooked aspect that may aid in the understanding of the effects of urbanization on species interactions is herbivory. Herbivores and leaf removal can signalize the effects of the habitat via their host plants. Another potentially useful measure for evaluating the effects of environmental stress on particular species is fluctuating asymmetry. We studied the herbivory levels and leaf fluctuating asymmetry on Solanum lycocarpum (Solanaceae) along an urban gradient in Brazil. The leaf area removed by folivores differed among sites and was significantly greater in the site with the higher level of urbanization. Also, the area removed varied significantly among individuals within urbanization sites. Similarly, the frequency of leaves with folivore damage was greater in the site with higher urbanization, although the area removed by them did not differ between shorter and larger plants. FA was significantly greater in the more urbanized sites in comparison with the other sites in the urbanization gradient and varied among individuals within site. Finally, we found a positive relationship between leaf area removed and FA values in the urbanization gradient. These results indicate that increased urbanization causes a reduction in habitat suitability for S. lycocarpum, which is reflected on higher FA levels. The leaf herbivores may benefit from the stress levels of hosts on more urbanized sites, which may have been caused by several factors acting in combination such as lower defenses, higher susceptibility and natural enemy pressures via habitat fragmentation/urbanization. This study exemplifies the variety of effects that urbanization exerts on remnant native populations and that fluctuating asymmetry could be a useful measure of the effects of these challenges on plant populations, and might also be used to assist management and conservation practices of natural areas within cities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Aim There is a wealth of information on species occurrences in biodiversity data banks, albeit presence-only, biased and scarce at fine resolutions. Moreover, fine-resolution species maps are required in biodiversity conservation. New techniques for dealing with this kind of data have been reported to perform well. These fine-resolution maps would be more robust if they could explain data at coarser resolutions at which species distributions are well represented. We present a new methodology for testing this hypothesis and apply it to invasive alien species (IAS). Location Catalonia, Spain. Methods We used species presence records from the Biodiversity data bank of Catalonia to model the distribution of ten IAS which, according to some recent studies, achieve their maximum distribution in the study area. To overcome problems inherent with the data, we prepared different correction treatments: three for dealing with bias and five for autocorrelation. We used the MaxEnt algorithm to generate models at 1-km resolution for each species and treatment. Acceptable models were upscaled to 10 km and validated against independent 10 km occurrence data. Results Of a total of 150 models, 20 gave acceptable results at 1-km resolution and 12 passed the cross-scale validation test. No apparent pattern emerged, which could serve as a guide on modelling. Only four species gave models that also explained the distribution at the coarser scale. Main conclusions Although some techniques may apparently deliver good distribution maps for species with scarce and biased data, they need to be taken with caution. When good independent data at a coarser scale are available, cross-scale validation can help to produce more reliable and robust maps. When no independent data are available for validation, however, new data gathering field surveys may be the only option if reliable fine-scale resolution maps are needed.},

abstract = {The two closely related noctuid moths Spodoptera latifascia and S. descoinsi have been found in sympatry in some parts of French Guiana. They differ by i) ecological preferences? ii) some anatomical features of the genital tract, iii) the relative amounts of the two main components of the female pheromonal blend, and iv) the temporal pattern of sexual behaviour. Viable and fertile interspecific hybrids can be obtained in the laboratory, thus permitting a genetic study of some of these traits. The anatomical differences cause perturbations in mating efficiency. Experimental results show that these differences are hereditarily transmitted, but their exact mode of inheritance remains unknown. The timing of initiation of female calling activity is very likely to be under polygenic control. Conclusive evidence showed that a pair of major autosomal alleles determined the pheromone composition. Moreover, some of the data suggest that the descoinsi allele would become lethal in certain mosaic latifascia/descoinsi genomic environments. The ecological factor is likely to be the major component of reproductive isolation between the two species in natural conditions. However in contact zones, the differences in pheromone composition and in timing of sexual activity are probably involved in preventing interspecific hybridization. Two speciation scenarios are proposed, both sympatric. In one of them, the primary event would be a fragmentation of the tropical forest followed by disruptive selection associated with habitat diversification. In the other, the speciation process might have been initiated by the occurrence of mutations acting on the pheromone mediated mate recognition system. Article},

abstract = {A major goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how diverging populations become species. The evolution of reproductive isolation (RI) halts the genomic homogenization caused by gene flow and recombination, and enables differentiation and local adaptations to become fixed between newly forming species. Selection can favor the strengthening of RI through a process termed reinforcement. Reinforcement occurs when selection favors traits that decrease mating between two incipient species in response to costly mating or the production of maladapted hybrids. Although this process has been investigated more frequently in animals, there is also evidence of reinforcement in plants. There are three strategies for the investigation of the process of reinforcement: case studies of species or diverging taxa; experimental evolution studies; and comparative studies. Here, I discuss how all three strategies find evidence consistent with reinforcement occurring in plants.

abstract = {Photoperiod is a reliable indicator of season and an important cue that many insects use for phenological synchronization. Undergoing range expansion insects can face a change in the local photoperiod to which they need to resynchronize. Rapid range expansion can be associated with rapid photoperiodic adaptation, which can be associated with intense selection on strongly heritable polygenic traits. Alternatively, it is proposed that, in insects with an XO sex-determination system, genes with large effect residing on the sex chromosome could drive photoperiodic adaptation because the gene or genes are exposed to selection in the sex carrying only a single X-chromosome. The present study seeks to understand which of these alternatives more likely explains the rapid photoperiodic adaptation in European Colorado potato beetles Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say. Diapause induction is assessed in beetles from a northern and a southern population, as well as from reciprocal hybrid crosses between the northern and southern population, when reared at an intermediate length photoperiod. The crosses within population display the expected responses, with the northern and southern populations showing high and low diapause propensity, respectively. The hybrids show intermediate responses in all studied traits. No clear difference in the responses in hybrids depending on the latitudinal origin of their father or mother is detected, even though partial paternal line dominance is seen in the responses of male beetles in one hybrid cross. These results therefore indicate that, in L. decemlineata, photoperiodic diapause induction is strongly heritable, and has an additive polygenic autosomal background. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Royal Entomological Society},

The moor frog (Rana arvalis) shows adaptive divergence in embryonic and larval fitness traits along an acidification gradient in south-western Sweden. To understand the quantitative genetic basis of this divergence, we performed reciprocal crosses between three divergent population pairs and reared embryos and larvae at acid and neutral pH in the laboratory. Divergence in embryonic acid tolerance (survival) was mainly determined by maternal effects, whereas the relative contributions of maternal, additive and nonadditive genetic effects in larval life-history traits differed between traits, population pairs and rearing environments. These results emphasize the need to investigate the quantitative genetic basis of adaptive divergence in multiple populations and traits, as well as different environments. We discuss the implications of our findings for maintenance of local adaptation in the context of migrant and hybrid fitness.},

abstract = {Predicting the distribution of endangered species from habitat data is frequently perceived to be a useful technique. Models that predict the presence or absence of a species are normally judged by the number of prediction errors. These may be of two types: false positives and false negatives. Many of the prediction errors can be traced to ecological processes such as unsaturated habitat and species interactions. Consequently, if prediction errors are not placed in an ecological context the results of the model may be misleading. The simplest, and most widely used, measure of prediction accuracy is the number of correctly classified cases. There are other measures of prediction success that may be more appropriate. Strategies for assessing the causes and costs of these errors are discussed. A range of techniques for measuring error in presence/absence models, including some that are seldom used by ecologists (e.g. ROC plots and cost matrices), are described. A new approach to estimating prediction error, which is based on the spatial characteristics of the errors, is proposed. Thirteen recommendations are made to enable the objective selection of an error assessment technique for ecological presence/absence models.},

@article{Delaney2010a,
abstract = {Background: Urbanization is a major cause of habitat fragmentation worldwide. Ecological and conservation theory predicts many potential impacts of habitat fragmentation on natural populations, including genetic impacts. Habitat fragmentation by urbanization causes populations of animals and plants to be isolated in patches of suitable habitat that are surrounded by non-native vegetation or severely altered vegetation, asphalt, concrete, and human structures. This can lead to genetic divergence between patches and in turn to decreased genetic diversity within patches through genetic drift and inbreeding. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined population genetic patterns using microsatellites in four common vertebrate species, three lizards and one bird, in highly fragmented urban southern California. Despite significant phylogenetic, ecological, and mobility differences between these species, all four showed similar and significant reductions in gene flow over relatively short geographic and temporal scales. For all four species, the greatest genetic divergence was found where development was oldest and most intensive. All four animals also showed significant reduction in gene flow associated with intervening roads and freeways, the degree of patch isolation, and the time since isolation. Conclusions/Significance: Despite wide acceptance of the idea in principle, evidence of significant population genetic changes associated with fragmentation at small spatial and temporal scales has been rare, even in smaller terrestrial vertebrates, and especially for birds. Given the striking pattern of similar and rapid effects across four common and widespread species, including a volant bird, intense urbanization may represent the most severe form of fragmentation, with minimal effective movement through the urban matrix.},

abstract = {Hybrids are generally less fit than their parental species, and the mechanisms underlying their fitness reductions can manifest through different traits. For example, hybrids can have physiological, behavioral, or ecological defects, and these defects can generate reproductive isolation between their parental species. However, the rate that mechanisms of postzygotic isolation other than hybrid sterility and inviability evolve has remained largely uninvestigated, despite isolated studies showing that behavioral defects in hybrids are not only possible but might be widespread. Here, we study a fundamental animal behavior—the ability of individuals to find food—and test the rate at which it breaks down in hybrids. We measured the ability of hybrids from 94 pairs of Drosophila species to find food and show that this ability decreases with increasing genetic divergence between the parental species and that male hybrids are more strongly (and negatively) affected than females. Our findings quantify the rate that hybrid dysfunction evolves across the diverse radiation of Drosophila and highlights the need for future investigations of the genetic and neurological mechanisms that affect a hybrid's ability to find a suitable substrate on which to feed and breed. K E Y W O R D S : Behavioral defects, drosophila, hybrids, speciation. Identifying and understanding the evolution of traits underly-ing reproductive isolation (RI) between species is central to our understanding of how biodiversity is generated and maintained (Palumbi 1994; Turelli et al. 2001; Coyne and Orr 2004; Wid-mer et al. 2009; Nosil 2012). Traits that generate RI between populations or species (collectively referred to as " taxa ") can act at different stages in the lifecycle of an organism. Traits affecting prezygotic isolation act before, and postzygotic traits act after, the formation of a zygote (Via 1999; Schluter 2001; Turelli et al. 2001; McKinnon et al. 2004). Prezygotic traits therefore tend to affect mating or gametic compatibility between taxa, while postzygotic traits typically involve developmental and behavioral dysgeneses that reduce the fitness of hybrids rela-tive to pure-species individuals (Turelli et al. 2001; Coyne and Orr 2004). A large diversity of traits affecting RI have now been iden-tified (Coyne and Orr 2004; Widmer et al. 2009; Nosil 2012) and a number of studies have employed phylogenetic compara-tive methods to measure the rates that their effects change with increasing divergence. In their seminal paper, Coyne and Orr (1989) analyzed how mate discrimination (a prezygotic trait) and hybrid sterility and inviability (both postzygotic traits) evolve be-tween pairs of Drosophila species as the divergence between them increases. Coyne and Orr (1989) showed that when two species were allopatric, mate discrimination, hybrid sterility, and hybrid inviability evolved at similar rates; however, when the species were sympatric, mate discrimination evolved more rapidly than both sterility and inviability. The general finding that traits affect-ing RI tend to become stronger as a monotonic function of the genetic distance between species has now been documented in diverse taxa including fungi (Giraud andGourb{\`{i}} ere 2012), fish (Mendelson 2003; Bolnick and Near 2005), frogs (Sasa et al. 1998), lizards (Singhal and Moritz 2013), butterflies (Presgraves 1998), and angiosperm plants (Moyle et al. 2004; Owens and Rieseberg 2014). These studies provide evidence that mismatched or dysfunctional phenotypes evolve faster in prezygotic than in postzygotic traits (Coyne and Orr 1989; Mendelson 2003; Bolnick and Near 2005; but see Edmands 2002), manifest more rapidly in hybrids of the heterogametic sex than in the homogametic sex (Coyne and Orr 1989; Presgraves 1998), and have asymmetric patterns of penetrance with respect to the maternal direction of a given cross (Bolnick and Near 2005). 9 6 0},

abstract = {We investigated body-size inheritance in interspecific sterile hybrids by crossing a Drosophila simulans strain with 13 strains of Drosophila melanogaster, which were of various origins and chosen for their broad range of genetic variation. A highly significant parent-offspring correlation was observed, showing that the D. melanogaster genes for size are still expressed in a hybrid background. Superimposed on to this additive inheritance, the size of hybrids was always less than the mid-parent value. This phenomenon, which at first sight might be described as dominance or overdominance, is more precisely interpreted as a consequence of a hybrid breakdown, that is, a dysfunction of the parental genes for size when put to work together. This interpretation is enforced by the fact that phenotypic variability was much more prevalent in hybrids than in parents. We also analysed body pigmentation inheritance in the same crosses and got a very different picture. There was no increase in the phenotypic variance of F(1) hybrids and only a low parent-offspring correlation. Apparent overdominance could be observed but in opposite directions, with no evidence of hybrid breakdown. Our data point to the possibility of analysing a diversity of quantitative traits in interspecific hybrids, and indicate that breakdown might be restricted to some traits only.},

Sexually selected traits are affected by the physical and social environment and should be especially susceptible to change, but this has rarely been studied. In southern California, dark-eyed juncos, (Junco hyemalis) naturally breed in mixed-coniferous temperate forests, typically from 1500 m to 3000 m in elevation. In the early 1980s, a small population became established in a coastal habitat, the University of California, San Diego campus, which has a mild, Mediterranean climate. I show that a sexually and socially selected signaling trait-the amount of white in the tail-has declined by approximately 22{\%} as compared to mountain juncos. I address three main factors that could explain the difference between mountain and coastal juncos: phenotypic plasticity, genetic drift, and selection. Results indicate that the first two can be ruled out as the sole cause of the plumage change, which implies that selection contributed to the genetic differentiation from the mountain population. The estimated rate of evolution is about 0.2 haldanes, comparable with rates of change in systems where individuals have been artificially introduced into new environments (e.g., guppies and Drosophila). This is the first study to demonstrate evolution of a sexually selected trait after only several generations resulting from a natural invasion into a novel environment.},

Potential arenas of influence include altered evolutionary trajectories within populations and modifications of the process of divergence among populations. We consider this second arena in the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) on Santa Cruz Island, Gal{\'{a}}pagos, Ecuador. Our study compared the G. fortis population at a relatively undisturbed site, El Garrapatero, to the population at a severely disturbed site, Academy Bay, which is immediately adjacent to the town of Puerto Ayora. The El Garrapatero population currently shows beak size bimodality that is tied to assortative mating and disruptive selection, whereas the Academy Bay population was historically bimodal but has lost this property in conjunction with a dramatic increase in local human population density. We here evaluate potential ecological-adaptive drivers of the differences in modality by quantifying relationships between morphology (beak and head dimensions), functional performance (bite force), and environmental characteristics (diet). Our main finding is that associations among these variables are generally weaker at Academy Bay than at El Garrapatero, possibly because novel foods are used at the former site irrespective of individual morphology and performance. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rugged adaptive landscapes promoting and maintaining diversification in nature can be smoothed by human activities, thus hindering ongoing adaptive radiation.},

abstract = {Shifts in host-plant use by phytophagous insects have played a central role in their diversification. Evolving host-use strategies will reflect a trade-off between selection pressures. The ecological niche of herbivorous insects is partitioned along several dimensions, and if populations remain in contact, recombination will break down associations between relevant loci. As such, genetic architecture can profoundly affect the coordinated divergence of traits and subsequently the ability to exploit novel habitats. The closely related species Heliconius cydno and H. melpomene differ in mimetic colour pattern, habitat and host-plant use. We investigate the selection pressures and genetic basis underlying host-use differences in these two species. Host-plant surveys reveal that H. melpomene specializes on a single species of Passiflora. This is also true for the majority of other Heliconius species in secondary growth forest at our study site, as expected under a model of interspecific competition. In contrast, H. cydno, which uses closed-forest habitats where both Heliconius and Passiflora are less common, appears not to be restricted by competition and uses a broad selection of the available Passiflora. However, other selection pressures are likely involved, and field experiments reveal that early larval survival of both butterfly species is highest on Passiflora menispermifolia, but most markedly so for H. melpomene, the specialist on that host. Finally, we demonstrate an association between host-plant acceptance and colour pattern amongst interspecific hybrids, suggesting that major loci underlying these important ecological traits are physically linked in the genome. Together, our results reveal ecological and genetic associations between shifts in habitat, host use and mimetic colour pattern that have likely facilitated both speciation and coexistence.},

We collected 3800 root fragments from four randomly positioned, 1-m-deep soil profiles (two vertical transects per plot), located in an old-field community in southern Ontario, Canada, and extracted and sequenced DNA from 1531 subsampled fragments. We identified species by comparing sequences with a DNA barcode reference library developed previously for the local flora. Nearly 85{\%} of sampled root fragments were successfully sequenced and identified as belonging to 29 plant species or species groups. Root abundance and species richness varied in horizontal space and were negatively correlated with soil depth. The relative abundance of taxa below-ground was correlated with their frequency above-ground (r = 0.73, P = 0.0001), but several species detected in root tissue were not observed in above-ground quadrats. Multivariate analyses indicated that diversity was highly structured below-ground, and associated with depth, root morphology, soil chemistry and soil texture, whereas little structure was evident above-ground. Furthermore, analyses of species co-occurrence indicates strong species segregation overall but random co-occurrence among confamilials. Our results provide insights into the role of environmental filtering and competitive interactions in the organization of plant diversity below-ground, and also demonstrate the utility of barcoding for the identification of plant roots.},

abstract = {Understanding the process by which hybrid incompatibility alleles become established in natural populations remains a major challenge to evolutionary biology. Previously, we discovered a two-locus Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility that causes severe hybrid male sterility between two inbred lines of the incompletely isolated wildflower species, Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus. An interspecific cross between these two inbred lines revealed that the M. guttatus (IM62) allele at hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) acts dominantly in combination with recessive M. nasutus (SF5) alleles at hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2) to cause nearly complete hybrid male sterility. In this report, we extend these genetic analyses to investigate intraspecific variation for the hms1-hms2 incompatibility in natural populations of M. nasutus and M. guttatus, performing a series of interspecific crosses between individuals collected from a variety of geographic locales. Our results suggest that hms2 incompatibility alleles are common and geographically widespread within M. nasutus, but absent or rare in M. guttatus. In contrast, the hms1 locus is polymorphic within M. guttatus and the incompatibility allele appears to be extremely geographically restricted. We found evidence for the presence of the hms1 incompatibility allele in only two M. guttatus populations that exist within a few kilometers of each other. The restricted distribution of the hms1 incompatibility allele might currently limit the potential for the hms1-hms2 incompatibility to act as a species barrier between sympatric populations of M. guttatus and M. nasutus. Extensive sampling within a single M. guttatus population revealed that the hms1 locus is polymorphic and that the incompatibility allele appears to segregate at intermediate frequency, a pattern that is consistent with either genetic drift or natural selection.},

abstract = {The direct and indirect effects of vegetative herbivory on the mating system of Impatiens capensis were analyzed through a survey of herbivory in natural I. capensis populations and manipulation of leaf damage in the field. Across 10 wild populations of I. capensis proportion of cleistogamous flowers had a significant positive exponential relationship with natural levels of herbivory. Similarly, experimental leaf damage increased the proportion of flowers and seeds that were cleistogamous. Leaf damage also reduced the biomass of cleistogamous progeny more severely relative to that of chasmogamous progeny. The cumulative effect of leaf damage was to increase plant reliance on fitness derived from cleistogamous progeny. Leaf damage indirectly affected mating system traits by reducing chasmogamous flower size, leading to a reduction in pollinator visitation. Under these experimental conditions, herbivory did not significantly reduce the number of simultaneously open flowers and potential for geitonogamy, nor did it result in significant changes in the composition of the pollinator fauna. These findings are among the first to demonstrate that herbivory has consequences for mating system and should be considered a factor shaping mating system evolution.},

These differences have implications for our ability to make inferences about the divergence from patterns in the relevant data. With this in mind, the models are investigated for their ability to account for three patterns evident in this data: (1) the asymmetrical nature of incompatibilities under reciprocal introgression; (2) the finding that multiple concurrent introgressions may be necessary for an incompatibility to form; and (3) the finding that the probability of obtaining an incompatibility by introgressing a single amino acid remains roughly constant over a wide range of genetic distances. None of the models available in the literature can account for all of the empirical patterns. However, modified versions of the models can do so. Ways of discriminating between the different models are then discussed.},

abstract = {T his year we celebrate the bicenten-nial of Darwin's birth and the sesquicentennial of Darwin's seminal work, The Origin of Species. A less-known anniversary is the centennial of William Bateson's (1909) genetic model of hybrid sterility and inviability. Bateson's model postulated that the lack of fertility and/or viability of hybrids arises from inter-actions among genes, a view that is generally held today. Recently, Hsin-Yi Lee et al. (2008) identified a pair of interacting genes, one mitochondrial and one autosomal, which contributes to sterility in hybrids in the manner pre-dicted by Bateson a century ago. Darwin saw hybrid sterility and invia-bility evolving as the by-product of other changes and not as adaptive per se, but lacked a genetic mechanism to illustrate this (reviewed in Johnson, 2008). Only 9 years after the rediscovery of Mendel's laws, Bateson (1909) proposed such a model. He recognized that a change at a single locus was unlikely to lead to hybrid sterility and inviability, because one or more of the nascent species would have to go through what would later be called an adaptive valley, as heterozy-gotes would be less fit than either homozygote (Gavrilets, 2004). If hybrid incompatibility was due to interactions among genetic changes at multiple sites, then both nascent species could evolve without either going through an adaptive valley. Bateson's model was neglected even in his own later works; most geneticists did not know of Bateson's contributions to the genetics of speciation until Orr's (1996) perspective in the journal Genetics. A generation after Bateson, Theodosius Dobzhansky (for example, 1937) and Herman Muller (for example, 1942) proposed and extended models similar to Bateson's. As Muller (1942) recognized, these genetic incom-patibilities can involve more than two loci. Regardless of the number of loci involved, these Bateson–Dobzhansky– Muller (BDM) incompatibilities form the basic paradigm for much of the current theory on the evolution of reproductive isolation, and therefore the formation of species (for example, Porter and Johnson, 2002; Gavrilets, 2004; Unckless and Orr, 2009). Substantial evidence exists for such BDM incompatibilities contributing to the sterility and inviability of interspecific hybrids across many taxa (Coyne and Orr, 2004). Until recently, that evidence consisted of chromosomal segments from one species interacting with different chromosomal segments from another species. Even when one gene affecting hybrid incompatibility was characterized, its partners were left unidentified. Work-ing with hybrids between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, Brideau et al. (2006) showed that interactions between the lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) gene from D. simulans and the hybrid male rescue (Hmr) gene from D. melanogaster contributed to the inviability of these hybrids. Until the study by Lee et al., the Lhr–Hmr interaction was the only clear example of such a BDM incompat-ibility. Moreover, D. melanogaster and D. simulans are a relatively old pair of species, which have undergone substan-tial functional divergence; the species normally do not produce any fertile hybrids and it is likely that hundreds of genes are involved in the sterility and inviability of their hybrids (Johnson and Kliman, 2002). The yeast species Saccharomyces cere-visiae and S. bayanus are closely related and somewhat intercrossable. To exam-ine the genetic basis of sterility of hybrids between these species, Lee et al. constructed chromosomal replace-ment lines; each contained one specified chromosome from S. bayanus with the rest of the genetic background being from S. cerevisiae. Most of these replace-ment lines were able to grow. Although chromosome 13 replacement lines were},

They represent heterogeneous ramet assemblages with marked differences in quality and attractiveness for herbivores. Here, feeding preferences of a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera exigua) for differently-aged ramets of Trifolium repens were studied, and changes in herbivore preference in response to systemic defense induction were investigated. Dual-choice tests were used to assess the preference of herbivores for young versus mature ramets of induced and uninduced plants, respectively. Additionally, leaf traits related to nutrition, biomechanics and chemical defense were measured to explain variation in tissue quality and herbivore preference. Young ramets were heavily damaged in control plants. After systemic defense induction, damage on young ramets was greatly reduced, while damage on mature ramets increased slightly. Defense induction increased leaf strength and thickness, decreased leaf soluble carbohydrates and substantially changed phenolic composition of undamaged ramets connected to attacked individuals. Systemic induced resistance led to a more dispersed feeding pattern among ramets of different ages. It is proposed that inducible defense acts as a risk-spreading strategy in clonal plants by equalizing herbivore preference within the clone, thereby avoiding extended selective feeding on valuable plant tissues.},

For example, if allelic variation at a major-effect locus fundamentally alters the structure of quantitative trait variation, then fixation of a single locus can have rapid and profound effects on the rate or direction of subsequent evolutionary change. Using an Arabidopsis thaliana RIL mapping population, we compare G-matrix structure between lines possessing different alleles at ERECTA, a locus known to affect ecologically relevant variation in plant architecture. We find that the allele present at ERECTA significantly alters G-matrix structure-in particular the genetic correlations between branch number and flowering time traits-and may also modulate the strength of natural selection on these traits. Despite these differences, however, when we extend our analysis to determine how evolution might differ depending on the ERECTA allele, we find that predicted responses to selection are similar. To compare responses to selection between allele classes, we developed a resampling strategy that incorporates uncertainty in estimates of selection that can also be used for statistical comparisons of G matrices.},

Most cultivars grown in the USA, however, are acyanogenic. White clover seedlings may be damaged or killed by insect feeding during establishment into a grass sod. The objective of this study was to determine if white clover stand establishment in a grass sod is influenced by cyanogenesis. Two cyanogenic white clover populations, HCNpi and BLHplus, and two acyanogenie populations, ‘Regal' and BLHminus, were sod-seeded into common bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] at two locations in 1994 and one location in 1995. The 1994 test in Forage Unit A was planted on an Oktibbeha silty clay (very-fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Dystrudert). The 1994 and 1995 tests in Forage Unit B were planted on a Savannah fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Fragiudult). The studies were conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replicates at Mississippi State, MS. Cotyledons, unifoliate leaves, and trifoliate leaves were rated for insect damage and leaf area loss due to insect feeding at 2, 4, and 6 wk after seeding. No differences were noted among the populations for seedling survival at 2 wk after seeding. At 4 and 6 wk after seeding, the highly cyanogenic population, HCNpi, had fewer plants with trifoliate leaves damaged and lost less leaf area due to insect feeding than either acyanogenic population. Seedling survival at 6 wk was 88{\%} for HCNpi, compared with 66{\%} for acyanogenic Regal. Cyanogenesis in white clover reduced insect feeding damage and improved seedling survival in bermudagrass sod. The incorporation of limited levels of cyanogenesis into acyanogenic U.S. cultivars could improve seedling establishment without the animal toxicity concerns of highly cyanogenic types.},

abstract = {The evolutionary significance of individual consistency in a given behaviour - called animal personality - has been subject to a lot of recent research. However, the genetic underpinnings of population divergence in mean personality have rarely been studied, especially across different ontogenetic stages. Previous work has shown that marine vs. pond populations of nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) have undergone adaptive divergence in a series of fitness-related traits, including behaviour. One particular behavioural trait important in this system is feeding activity: giant pond sticklebacks are more active feeders than their normal sized marine conspecifics. In a common garden experiment, we raised individuals from pure and hybrid F1 -generation crosses of a highly divergent marine - pond population pair to see if (i) feeding activity and/or its ontogenetic change was consistent between individuals, and if (ii) population divergence at different ontogenetic stages could be explained by additive genetic, nonadditive genetic or maternal effects. We found that feeding activity decreased with age, but that these changes were consistently different among both individuals and crosses. The among cross patterns were consistent with a nonadditive genetic scenario: in the early period pond sticklebacks expressed dominance for high feeding activity, while in the late period marine sticklebacks expressed dominance for low feeding activity. We conclude that nine-spined sticklebacks exhibit different feeding personalities, and that the population divergence in feeding personality is explainable by age-dependent expression of genetic dominance.},

Our meta-analysis is based on more than 3000 rates of phenotypic change in 68 'systems', each representing a given species in a particular geographical area. We find that rates of phenotypic change are greater in anthropogenic contexts than in natural contexts. This difference may be influenced by phenotypic plasticity - because it was evident for studies of wild-caught individuals (which integrate both genetic and plastic effects) but not for common-garden or quantitative genetic studies (which minimize plastic effects). We also find that phenotypic changes in response to disturbance can be remarkably abrupt, perhaps again because of plasticity. In short, humans are an important agent driving phenotypic change in contemporary populations. Although these changes sometimes have a genetic basis, our analyses suggest a particularly important contribution from phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract = {The existence of a continuous array of sympatric biotypes - from polymorphisms, through ecological or host races with increasing reproductive isolation, to good species - can provide strong evidence for a continuous route to sympatric speciation via natural selection. Host races in plant-feeding insects, in particular, have often been used as evidence for the probability of sympatric speciation. Here, we provide verifiable criteria to distinguish host races from other biotypes: in brief, host races are genetically differentiated, sympatric populations of parasites that use different hosts and between which there is appreciable gene flow. We recognize host races as kinds of species that regularly exchange genes with other species at a rate of more than ca. 1{\%} per generation, rather than as fundamentally distinct taxa. Host races provide a convenient, although admittedly somewhat arbitrary intermediate stage along the speciation continuum. They are a heuristic device to aid in evaluating the probability of speciation by natural selection, particularly in sympatry. Speciation is thereby envisaged as having two phases: (i) the evolution of host races from within polymorphic, panmictic populations; and (ii) further reduction of gene flow between host races until the diverging populations can become generally accepted as species. We apply this criterion to 21 putative host race systems. Of these, only three are unambiguously classified as host races, but a further eight are strong candidates that merely lack accurate information on rates of hybridization or gene flow. Thus, over one-half of the cases that we review are probably or certainly host races, under our definition. Our review of the data favours the idea of sympatric speciation via host shift for three major reasons: (i) the evolution of assortative mating as a pleiotropic by-product of adaptation to a new host seems likely, even in cases where mating occurs away from the host; (ii) stable genetic differences in half of the cases attest to the power of natural selection to maintain multilocus polymorphisms with substantial linkage disequilibrium, in spite of probable gene flow; and (iii) this linkage disequilibrium should permit additional host adaptation, leading to further reproductive isolation via pleiotropy, and also provides conditions suitable for adaptive evolution of mate choice (reinforcement) to cause still further reductions in gene flow. Current data are too sparse to rule out a cryptic discontinuity in the apparently stable sympatric route from host-associated polymorphism to host-associated species, but such a hiatus seems unlikely on present evidence. Finally, we discuss applications of an understanding of host races in conservation and in managing adaptation by pests to control strategies, including those involving biological control or transgenic parasite-resistant plants.},

In diverging three-spined stickleback ecotypes from two lakes and two rivers, we observed differences in sperm traits between lake and river males. Interestingly, these differences did not translate into ecotype-specific gamete precedence for sympatric males in competitive in vitro fertilization experiments, potentially owing to antagonistic compensatory effects. However, we observed indirect evidence for impeded development of inter-ecotype zygotes, possibly suggesting an early stage of genetic incompatibility between ecotypes. Our results show that pre-zygotic post-copulatory mechanisms play a minor role during this first stage of ecotype divergence, but suggest that genetic incompatibilities may arise at early stages of ecological speciation.},

Each species preferred almost exclusively its host plant, creating strong prezygotic isolation between them, and suggesting that speciation may occur at least partly in sympatry.

The genetic basis of preference and performance was at least partially independent, and several loci coded for preference, which limits the possibility of sympatric speciation. Hence, both ecological and intrinsic factors may contribute to speciation between these species.},

abstract = {Timely and accurate biodiversity analysis poses an ongoing challenge for the success of biomonitoring programs. Morphology-based identification of bioindicator taxa is time consuming, and rarely supports species-level resolution especially for immature life stages. Much work has been done in the past decade to develop alternative approaches for biodiversity analysis using DNA sequence-based approaches such as molecular phylogenetics and DNA barcoding. On-going assembly of DNA barcode reference libraries will provide the basis for a DNA-based identification system. The use of recently introduced next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches in biodiversity science has the potential to further extend the application of DNA information for routine biomonitoring applications to an unprecedented scale. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using 454 massively parallel pyrosequencing for species-level analysis of freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate taxa commonly used for biomonitoring. We designed our experiments in order to directly compare morphology-based, Sanger sequencing DNA barcoding, and next-generation environmental barcoding approaches. Our results show the ability of 454 pyrosequencing of mini-barcodes to accurately identify all species with more than 1{\%} abundance in the pooled mixture. Although the approach failed to identify 6 rare species in the mixture, the presence of sequences from 9 species that were not represented by individuals in the mixture provides evidence that DNA based analysis may yet provide a valuable approach in finding rare species in bulk environmental samples. We further demonstrate the application of the environmental barcoding approach by comparing benthic macroinvertebrates from an urban region to those obtained from a conservation area. Although considerable effort will be required to robustly optimize NGS tools to identify species from bulk environmental samples, our results indicate the potential of an environmental barcoding approach for biomonitoring programs.},

abstract = {Although divergent natural selection is common in nature, the extent to which genetic constraints bias evolutionary trajectories in its presence remains largely unknown. Here we develop a general framework to integrate estimates of divergent selection and genetic constraints to estimate their contributions to phenotypic divergence among natural populations. We apply these methods to estimates of phenotypic selection and genetic covariance from sexually selected traits that have undergone adaptive divergence among nine natural populations of the fly Drosophila serrata. Despite ongoing sexual selection within populations, differences in its direction among them, and genetic variance for all traits in all populations, divergent sexual selection only weakly resembled the observed pattern of divergence. Accounting for the influence of genetic covariance among the traits significantly improved the alignment between observed and predicted divergence. Our results suggest that the direction in which sexual selection generates divergence may depend on the pattern of genetic constraint in individual populations, ultimately restricting how sexually selected traits may diversify. More generally, we show how evolution is likely to proceed in the direction of major axes of genetic variance, rather than the direction of selection itself, when genetic variance-covariance matrices are ill conditioned and genetic variance is low in the direction of selection.},

abstract = {This paper examines the responses of F-1 hybrids between two closely related chrysomelid beetles to the host plants of their parents. Ophraella notulata (NTL) and O. slobodkini (SLB) feed exclusively on the asteraceous plants Iva frutescens and Ambrosia artemisiifolia, respectively. Virgin males and females were crossed in all possible combinations and their progeny were tested for host preference, host acceptability and larval survival on each host plant. NTL x SLB (female x male) pairings did not produce viable eggs. Comparisons of larval responses between the crosses showed strong dominance for most traits measured. Hybrid larvae (SLB x NTL) resembled SLB for host preference and the acceptability of A. artemisiifolia, but they resembled NTL for larval survival. The acceptability of I. flutescens appeared to be inherited additively. These results suggest that the genes responsible for recognizing and accepting the two host plants and for host preference and performance are inherited independently. More detailed studies of the inheritance of host-use traits are needed to determine how common such dominance patterns are and how many loci control such traits, both of which have important implications for theories of how host plant associations evolve.},

abstract = {The process of speciation in birds can be inferred from the pattern of diversification on islands, especially in archipelagos. The basic model is one of initial differentiation of allopatric populations, with further differentiation taking place at the time that sympatry is established. Differences that evolve in allopatry are reinforced by a regime of divergent selection on the taxa in sympatry arising from ecological pressures and not from reproductive (genetic) incompatibility. A low level of interbreeding (hybridization) at the secondary contact phase and subsequently may occur with little or no fitness loss. Introgressive hybridization has the potential to play a creative role in evolution, facilitating further divergence by enhancing genetic variation and relaxing genetic constraints on particular directions of evolutionary change under natural selection. Hybridization potential may last for many millions of years after two taxa diverge, implying that post-zygotic isolation evolves slowly. The main alternative model of speciation in island birds is the peripatric model. It emphasizes major genetic changes taking place in the founding of a new population by a small number of individuals. There is no direct evidence that would make it preferable to the standard allopatric model for islands.},

In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T2 type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different REML analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

The nature of the divergences between sympatric species,factors contributing to reproductive isolation, and modes of evolutionare reviewed with particular emphasis on benthic and limnetic pairs ofthreespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus, and anadromous(sockeye salmon) and nonanadromous (kokanee) pairs of Oncorhynchusnerka. Phylogenetic analyses typically indicate that divergencesbetween members of replicate pairs have occurred independently and,hence, particular phenotypes are not monophyletic. Consequently,taxonomic resolution of such ‘species complexes' is a vexing problem foradherents to our traditional Linnaean classification system. Sympatricspecies pairs represent a significant component of the biodiversity oftemperate freshwater ecosystems which may be underestimated because oursystem of formal taxonomy tends to obscure diversity encompassed byspecies pairs. Conservation of such systems should be recognized as apriority without formal taxonomic designation of members of speciespairs because taxonomic resolution will likely continue to proveextremely difficult when employing traditional hierarchies andprocedures.},

In addition to significant heritabilities for all traits, we also documented genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity for head width. A phenotypic selection analysis demonstrated (1) a strong positive relationship between the percentage seed-set and the overall cross-fertility determined in a previous greenhouse study, (2) non-linear selection on plant height with an optimum above the population mean, and (3) a negative correlation between seed-set and the number of heads on the plant. No selection on head width could be detected and there was a relatively small decline in seed-set following the removal of all rays (15{\%}). Multiple regression using paternal family means largely confirmed the patterns of selection seen at the phenotypic level.},

The recent development of cost-effective methods for obtaining high-quality genome-scale data makes it possible to identify some of the loci responsible for adaptive differences among populations. Two basic approaches for identifying putatively locally adaptive loci have been developed and are broadly used: one that identifies loci with unusually high genetic differentiation among populations (differentiation outlier methods) and one that searches for correlations between local population allele frequencies and local environments (genetic-environment association methods). Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scan methods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species' demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations. In each case, we make suggestions for best practices for maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of genome scans to detect the underlying genetic basis of local adaptation.

It has long been suspected to be allotetraploid, but the diploid ancestral species have remained elusive. Putative diploid ancestors were indicated by DNA sequence phylogeny to be T. pallescens and T. occidentale. Here, we use further DNA evidence as well as a combination of molecular cytogenetics (FISH and GISH) and experimental hybridization to test the hypothesis that white clover originated as a hybrid between T. pallescens and T. occidentale.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: T. pallescens plants were identified with chloroplast trnL intron DNA sequences identical to those of white clover. Similarly, T. occidentale plants with nuclear ITS sequences identical to white clover were also identified. Reciprocal GISH experiments, alternately using labeled genomic DNA probes from each of the putative ancestral species on the same white clover cells, showed that half of the chromosomes hybridized with each probe. F1 hybrids were generated by embryo rescue and these showed strong interspecific chromosome pairing and produced a significant frequency of unreduced gametes, indicating the likely mode of polyploidization. The F1 hybrids are inter-fertile with white clover and function as synthetic white clovers, a valuable new resource for the re-incorporation of ancestral genomes into modern white clover for future plant breeding.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Evidence from DNA sequence analyses, molecular cytogenetics, interspecific hybridization and breeding experiments supports the hypothesis that a diploid alpine species (T. pallescens) hybridized with a diploid coastal species (T. occidentale) to generate tetraploid T. repens. The coming together of these two narrowly adapted species (one alpine and the other maritime), along with allotetraploidy, has led to a transgressive hybrid with a broad adaptive range.},

In a perennial, outcrossing model plant Arabidopsis lyrata, several differentiated phenotypic traits contribute to local adaptation, as demonstrated by fitness advantage of the local population at each site in reciprocal transplant experiments. Here we compared fitness components, hierarchical total fitness and differentiation in putatively ecologically important traits of plants from two diverged parental populations from different continents in the native climate conditions of the populations in Norway and in North Carolina (NC, U.S.A.). Survival and number of fruits per inflorescence indicated local advantage at both sites and aster life-history models provided additional evidence for local adaptation also at the level of hierarchical total fitness. Populations were also differentiated in flowering start date and floral display. We also included reciprocal experimental F-1 and F-2 hybrids to examine the genetic basis of adaptation. Surprisingly, the F-2 hybrids showed heterosis at the study site in Norway, likely because of a combination of beneficial dominance effects from different traits. At the NC site, hybrid fitness was mostly intermediate relative to the parental populations. Local cytoplasmic origin was associated with higher fitness, indicating that cytoplasmic genomes also may contribute to the evolution of local adaptation.},

abstract = {Previous mathematical analyses of mutation-selection balance for metric traits assume that selection acts on the relevant loci only through the character(s) under study. Thus, they implicitly assume that all of the relevant mutation and selection parameters are estimable. A more realistic analysis must recognize that many of the pleiotropic effects of loci contributing variation to a given character are not known. To explore the consequences of these hidden effects, I analyze models of two pleiotropically connected polygenic traits, denoted P1 and P2. The actual equilibrium genetic variance for P1, based on complete knowledge of all mutation and selection parameters for both P1 and P2, can be compared to a prediction based solely on observations of P1. This extrapolation mimics empirically obtainable predictions because of the inevitability of unknown pleiotropic effects. The mutation parameters relevant to P1 are assumed to be known, but selection intensity is estimated from the within-generation reduction of phenotypic variance for P1. The extrapolated prediction is obtained by substituting these parameters into formulas based on single-character analyses. Approximate analytical and numerical results show that the level of agreement between these univariate extrapolations and the actual equilibrium variance depends critically on both the genetic model assumed and the relative magnitudes of the mutation and selection parameters. Unless per locus mutation rates are extremely high, i.e., generally greater than 10(-4), the widely used gaussian approximation for genetic effects at individual loci is not applicable. Nevertheless, the gaussian approximations predict that the true and extrapolated equilibria are in reasonable agreement, i.e., within a factor of two, over a wide range of parameter values. In contrast, an alternative approximation that applies for moderate and low per locus mutation rates predicts that the extrapolation will generally overestimate the true equilibrium variance unless there is little selection associated with hidden effects. The tendency to overestimate is understandable because selection acts on all of the pleiotropic manifestations of a new mutation, but equilibrium covariances among the characters affected may not reveal all of this selection. This casts doubt on the proposal that much of the additive polygenic variance observed in natural populations can be explained by mutation-selection balance. It also indicates the difficulty of critically evaluating this hypothesis.},

abstract = {Genes underlying repeated adaptive evolution in natural populations are still largely unknown. Stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have undergone a recent dramatic evolutionary radiation, generating numerous examples of marine-freshwater species pairs and a small number of benthic-limnetic species pairs found within single lakes [1]. We have developed a new genome-wide SNP genotyping array to study patterns of genetic variation in sticklebacks over a wide geographic range, and to scan the genome for regions that contribute to repeated evolution of marine-freshwater or benthic-limnetic species pairs. Surveying 34 global populations with 1,159 informative markers revealed substantial genetic variation, with predominant patterns reflecting demographic history and geographic structure. After correcting for geographic structure and filtering for neutral markers, we detected large repeated shifts in allele frequency at some loci, identifying both known and novel loci likely contributing to marine-freshwater and benthic-limnetic divergence. Several novel loci fall close to genes implicated in epithelial barrier or immune functions, which have likely changed as sticklebacks adapt to contrasting environments. Specific alleles differentiating sympatric benthic-limnetic species pairs are shared in nearby solitary populations, suggesting an allopatric origin for adaptive variants and selection pressures unrelated to sympatry in the initial formation of these classic vertebrate species pairs. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Urbanization of natural habitats is considered to have large impacts on local plant populations and their associated pollinator faunas, which are expected to cause changes in both plant-pollinator interactions and increased pollen limitation. This study investigated the effects of increasing intensity of urban land use on pollinator diversity, flower visitation rates and reproductive success in Digitalis purpurea. To this end, we set up experimental populations of D. purpurea in three urban-rural gradients and contrasted these against two large, natural populations. In the experimental populations we quantified the number of flower visits per 20. min and applied supplemental hand-pollinations to determine the impact of pollen limitation on fruit-level seed set. We found no impact of urbanization intensity on pollinator diversity at all locations studied, and also the number of flower visits did not differ significantly between urban and rural populations. Reproductive success appeared, however, pollen limited in all sites, even in the large and optimal reference populations. This led us to conclude that the pollen limitation was caused by a bet-hedging strategy of the species rather than by insufficient pollination. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We explore the evolution of dominance at polymorphisms maintained either by overdominant selection or by migration- selection balance. At such balanced polymorphisms, heterozygotes remain at appreciable frequencies over long periods of time, allowing extensive modification of dominance to occur. The strength of selection favoring a modifier of dominance is roughly proportional to the probability that a modifier allele is found in a heterozygote at the locus subject to balancing selection times the heterozygote fitness increase caused by the modifier. Using a two-locus model, we elucidate the interesting ways in which recombination and migration cause departures from this rough expectation. For example, with overdominance, a genetic association with the rarest allele favors a modifier that increases heterozygote fitness because the modifier occurs more often in heterozygotes. With migration-selection balance, dominance evolves more readily in patches experiencing the strongest selection. We also find that, while there are more heterozygotes in sink populations (which have higher rates of immigration than emigration), selection for dominance in sink and source populations is nearly equal because sink populations make a lower genetic contribution to future generations. We conclude that the evolution of dominance is likely to occur whenever polymorphism is maintained by either overdominance or migration},

abstract = {The evolution of different forms of pollen aggregation (tetrads, polyads, pollen threads, pollinia) from individual monads is a recurring transition in angiosperm history, having occurred independently at least 39 times. Aggregation should evolve only under special circumstances, because diminishing returns associated with pollen removal and receipt instead favor monads that act largely independently. All forms of aggregation result in sibling pollen grains acting together, but they seem to evolve to ease different limitations on siring success: tetrads may evolve most commonly when pollinators visit infrequently, pollen threads may be most beneficial when ovules become available synchronously, and pollinia greatly increase the probability that a pollen grain removed by a pollinator reaches a conspecific stigma. Once pollen aggregation evolves, its implications for gametophytic competition and the relatedness of seeds within fruits probably influence further reproductive evolution, especially the frequency with which pollen from a single donor sires all seeds in a fruit. This latter effect, rather than improvements in pollination efficiency, probably accounts for the common association of pollen aggregation with lowpollen : ovule ratios. The ability of orchid pollinia to reduce diminishing returns during pollination may explain both the floral diversity and the widespread occurrence of deceit pollination in this clade.},

We found that ontogeny is a major factor affecting this insect. Its importance rivaled leaf physiological age, a well-documented factor, which served as our standard for judging the relative importance of other effects. Three patterns emerged: (1) In the field, beetle feeding was nine times greater in the adult zone than in the juvenile zone of heteroblastic trees (i.e., trees with both adult and juvenile foliage). (2) Laboratory feeding trials confirmed their strong preference for adult foliage. (3) Although eucalypt species, hybrid cross type (F-1, F-2, and backcrosses), and canopy height also exhibited significant effects on beetle feeding in laboratory trials, their relative importance was much less than ontogeny and leaf physiological age. We conclude that beetles perceive greater variation in host quality within individual plants than between different eucalypt species and their hybrids. The magnitude of these effects argues that ontogeny may rival other better studied plant traits that affect herbivores. We discuss how genetic regulation of phenotypic expression in plants may affect herbivore populations and structure communities.},

Because such cryptic barriers to gene exchange involve post-mating sexual interactions, analyses of their evolution have focused on sexual conflict or traditional sexual selection. Here, we show that ecological divergence between populations of herbivorous walking sticks is integral to the evolution of cryptic reproductive isolation. Low female fitness following between-population mating can reduce gene exchange between populations, thus acting as a form of cryptic isolation. Female walking sticks show reduced oviposition rate and lower lifetime fecundity following between-population versus within-population mating, but only for mating between populations using different host-plant species. Our results indicate that even inherently sexual forms of reproductive isolation can evolve as a by-product of ecological divergence and that post-mating sexual interactions do not necessarily evolve independently of the ecological environment.},

Variation in lateral line morphology may allow fish in different habitats to differentially sense and respond to salient cues. Threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) occupy a diverse range of aquatic habitats; we therefore hypothesized that populations within the G. aculeatus species complex might show variation in the morphology of the lateral line sensory system. We sampled 16 threespine stickleback populations from marine, stream and lake (including benthic and limnetic) habitats and examined the distribution, type and number of neuromasts on different regions of the body. We found that the threespine stickleback has a reduced lateral line canal system, completely lacking canal neuromasts. Although the arrangement of lines of superficial neuromasts on the body was largely the same in all populations, the number of neuromasts within these lines varied across individuals, populations and habitats. In pairwise comparisons between threespine sticklebacks adapted to divergent habitats, we found significant differences in neuromast number. Stream residents had more neuromasts than marine sticklebacks living downstream in the same watershed. In two independent lakes, benthic sticklebacks had more trunk neuromasts than sympatric limnetic sticklebacks, providing evidence for parallel evolution of the lateral line system. Our data provide the first demonstration that the lateral line sensory system can vary significantly between individuals and among populations within a single species, and suggest that this sensory system may experience different selection regimes in alternative habitats.},

Temperature-associated cyanogenesis clines occur in both native and introduced populations. Whereas the selective factors favoring cyanide-producing plants in warm climates are well established (differential protection against generalist herbivores), those favoring acyanogenic plants in colder regions are less well understood. We tested the hypothesis originally proposed to explain this pattern: that cyanogenic plants suffer increased tissue death following freezing as a result of frost-induced cyanide autotoxicity. Tissue damage was assessed in laboratory freeze treatments at three temperatures: - 10 degrees, -11.5 degrees, and -13 degrees C. We examined cyanogenic and acyanogenic genotypes sampled from across the species range, as well as from polymorphic populations sampled in NorthCarolina. Cyanogenic genotypes exhibited lower freezing tolerance in the species-wide sample but showed no similar trend in comparisons of plants from polymorphic populations; statistical power was reduced in the latter analysis and may be a contributing factor. These results indicate that expanded genotype sampling of polymorphic populations is warranted, and they tentatively suggest that factors such as herbivore abundance and resource allocation trade-offs may contribute to the occurrence of cyanogenesis clines in white clover.},

Here, we present a genetic analysis of the courtship song differences between two closely related grasshopper species Ch. albomarginatus and Ch. oschei. Measurements of seven courtship song characters and one parameter of courtship visual display were compared among parentals, F(1) and F(2) hybrids, and backcrosses. Variation in one morphological character, the number of stridulatory pegs, was studied as well. The distributions of song phenotypes were more consistent with a type-III genetic architecture, which involves complementary or duplicate pairs of loci. We suggest that this type of architecture may provide the novel elements of the hybrid songs, even more complex than the parental ones, which may offer a new starting point for sexual selection. One parameter of the visual display appeared to be controlled by a single locus, but differences in other characters of visual display could be explained by a more complex inheritance pattern. Inheritance of the peg number differences was consistent with a simple polygenic additive model. Sex linkage and/or maternal effects were not detected for any trait. We found a disproportionate influence of the Ch. albomarginatus parent on most hybrid song characteristics and the visual display, and this may support a previously suggested idea that Ch. albomarginatus is an ancestral form and Ch. oschei is a derived species.},

abstract = {The origins of hybrid zones between parapatric taxa have been of particular interest for understanding the evolution of reproductive isolation and the geographic context of species divergence. One challenge has been to distinguish between allopatric divergence (followed by secondary contact) versus primary intergradation (parapatric speciation) as alternative divergence histories. Here, we use complementary phylogeographic and population genetic analyses to investigate the recent divergence of two subspecies of Clarkia xantiana and the formation of a hybrid zone within the narrow region of sympatry. We tested alternative phylogeographic models of divergence using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and found strong support for a secondary contact model and little support for a model allowing for gene flow throughout the divergence process (i.e. primary intergradation). Two independent methods for inferring the ancestral geography of each subspecies, one based on probabilistic character state reconstructions and the other on palaeo-distribution modelling, also support a model of divergence in allopatry and range expansion leading to secondary contact. The membership of individuals to genetic clusters suggests geographic substructure within each taxon where allopatric and sympatric samples are primarily found in separate clusters. We also observed coincidence and concordance of genetic clines across three types of molecular markers, which suggests that there is a strong barrier to gene flow. Taken together, our results provide evidence for allopatric divergence followed by range expansion leading to secondary contact. The location of refugial populations and the directionality of range expansion are consistent with expectations based on climate change since the last glacial maximum. Our approach also illustrates the utility of combining phylogeographic hypothesis testing with species distribution modelling and fine-scale population genetic analyses for inferring the geography of the divergence process.},

Wild boar Sus scrofa are establishing a permanent presence in many cities in Europe, with the largest German urban population occurring in Berlin. Despite their relatively long-term presence, there is little knowledge of colonization processes, dispersal patterns or connectivity of Berlin's populations, hampering the development of effective management plans. We used 13 microsatellite loci to genotype 387 adult and subadult wild boar from four urban forests, adjacent built-up areas and the surrounding rural forests. We applied genetic clustering algorithms to analyse the population genetic structure of the urban boar. We used approximate Bayesian computation to infer the boar's colonization history of the city. Finally, we used assignment tests to determine the origin of wild boar hunted in the urban built-up areas. The animals in three urban forests formed distinct genetic clusters, with the remaining samples all being assigned to one rural population. One urban cluster was founded by individuals from another urban cluster rather than by rural immigrants. The wild boar that had been harvested within urban built-up areas was predominantly assigned to the rural cluster surrounding the urban area, rather than to one of the urban clusters. Synthesis and applications. Our results are likely to have an immediate impact on management strategies for urban wild board populations in Berlin, because they show that there are not only distinct urban clusters, but also ongoing source–sink dynamics between urban and rural areas. It is therefore essential that the neighbouring Federal States of Berlin and Brandenburg develop common hunting plans to control the wild boar population and reduce conflicts in urban areas.},

However, several examples show that the same phenotype might evolve among populations within a species by changes in different genes. Conversely, similar phenotypes might evolve in distantly related species by changes in the same gene. We thus argue that the distinction between 'convergent' and 'parallel' evolution is a false dichotomy, at best representing ends of a continuum.

We surveyed the protein target for cardenolides, the alpha subunit of the sodium pump, Na(+),K(+)-ATPase (ATP$\alpha$), in 14 species that feed on cardenolide-producing plants and 15 outgroups spanning three insect orders. Despite the large number of potential targets for modulating cardenolide sensitivity, amino acid substitutions associated with host-plant specialization are highly clustered, with many parallel substitutions. Additionally, we document four independent duplications of ATP$\alpha$ with convergent tissue-specific expression patterns. We find that unique substitutions are disproportionately associated with recent duplications relative to parallel substitutions. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that adaptation tends to take evolutionary paths that minimize negative pleiotropy.},

abstract = {Unreduced gametes, which have the somatic (2n) chromosome number, are an important precursor to polyploid formation and apomixis. The product of irregularities in meiosis, 2n gametes are expected to be rare and deleterious in most natural populations, contrary to their wide taxonomic distribution and the prevalence of polyploidy. To better understand this discrepancy, we review contemporary evidence related to four aspects of 2n gamete dynamics in natural populations: (i) estimates of their frequency; (ii) their environmental and genetic determinants; (iii) adaptive and nonadaptive processes regulating their evolution; and (iv) factors regulating their union and production of polyploids in diploid populations. Aided by high-throughput methods of detection, these foci will advance our understanding of variation in 2n gametes within and among species, and their role in polyploid evolution. Research on the population biology and evolutionary dynamics of polyploidy tends to focus on the establishment phase of polyploid evolution; less research is available on the formation phase.Recent advances in high-throughput methods (flow cytometry and volumetric measures) enable large-scale sampling and experimental studies of male 2n gametes in natural populations.Studies of 2n gamete production in natural populations indicate they are widespread; within populations, most individuals have near-zero levels but rare individuals can produce much higher frequencies.A disparity is observed between 2n gamete frequency estimates in natural populations and rates of neopolyploid production.Mode of reproduction (including asexual and sexual modes) has been observed to have some bearing on the prevalence of 2n gametes, which may reflect adaptive or nonadaptive evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {Abstract The grasshoppers Chorthippus brunneus and Chorthippus jacobsi are highly differentiated for male mating signals, and form a mosaic hybrid zone in northern Spain. At some sites within this zone, many hybrids are observed. At others, few hybrids are observed. Such bimodal sites may reflect recent contacts between parental genotypes, or local variation in levels of assortative mating or selection against hybrids. Playback of 12 parental and F1 male songs to 296 parental and hybrid females revealed positive assortative preferences in C. brunneus and C. jacobsi females, supporting a direct role of male mating signals in female choice. However, all female genotypic classes showed reduced responsiveness to F1 male songs. Such sexual selection against hybrids is consistent with the narrow cline width observed in the field for song characters relative to morphology. These results have implications for the genetic structure of the hybrid zone and for models of speciation by reinforcement.},

abstract = {1. Species differ widely in the size and ecological characteristics of their geographic ranges. This variation reflects, in part, differences in ecological tolerance among taxa, but the influence of phylogeny and evolutionary divergence through genome duplication remains controversial. 2. Here, we examine the evolutionary sources of variation in species range area, latitudinal position and overlap, and six range climatic variables (maximum, minimum and breadth of temperature and precipitation) for North American angiosperms. We sampled two diploid and one polyploid species from each of 144 genera and examined sources of variation in a nested taxonomic analysis and congeneric species pairs comparison. 3. For all range characteristics studied, a significant portion of the variance among species (mean 53{\%}, range 37201360{\%}) was attributable to taxonomic membership above species (i.e. genus, family and order). Four of the seven range attributes were significantly correlated between diploid congeners (e.g. range area rs = 0.65) and between heteroploid (diploid and polyploid) congeners (e.g. range area rs = 0.62). The strength of correlations between heteroploid relatives was not consistently different than correlations between diploids. 4. No differences in mean range breadth (range area, temperature breadth, precipitation breadth) or climatological position (minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation) were observed between diploid and polyploid congeners. Polyploids were not more likely to occupy northern latitudinal positions and were no more displaced from diploids than other congeneric diploids. 5.Synthesis. Our results suggest that, at the scale of North America, the geographical and ecological aspects of species ranges are influenced by phylogenetic history. Furthermore, genome duplication does not cause or allow greater divergence in species range characteristics than occurs between related diploid species.},

abstract = {The role of hybridization in the evolution of animal species is poorly understood. Transgressive segregation is a mechanism through which hybridization can generate diversity and ultimately lead to speciation. In this report we investigated the capacity of hybridization to generate novel (transgressive) phenotypes in the taxonomically diverse cichlid fishes. We generated a large F 2 hybrid population by crossing two closely related cichlid species from Lake Malawi in Africa with differently shaped heads. Our morphometric analysis focused on two traits with different selective histories. The cichlid lower jaw (mandible) has evolved in response to strong directional selection, and does not segregate beyond the parental phenotype. The cichlid neurocranium (skull) has likely diverged in response to forces other than consistent directional selection (e.g., stabilizing selection), and exhibits marked transgressive seg-regation in our F 2 population. We show that the genetic architecture of the cichlid jaw limits transgression, whereas the genetic basis of skull shape is permissive of transgressive segregation. These data suggest that natural selection, acting through the genome, will limit the degree of diversity that may be achieved via hybridization. Results are discussed in the context of the broader question of how phenotypic diversity may be achieved in rapidly evolving systems.},

abstract = {Most plants attract multiple flower visitors that may vary widely in their effectiveness as pollinators. Floral evolution is expected to reflect interactions with the most important pollinators, but few studies have quantified the contribution of different pollinators to current selection on floral traits. To compare selection mediated by diurnal and nocturnal pollinators on floral display and spur length in the rewarding orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, we manipulated the environment by conducting supplemental hand-pollinations and selective pollinator exclusions in two populations in central Norway. In both populations, the exclusion of diurnal pollinators significantly reduced seed production compared to open pollination, whereas the exclusion of nocturnal pollinators did not. There was significant selection on traits expected to influence pollinator attraction and pollination efficiency in both the diurnal and nocturnal pollination treatment. The relative strength of selection among plants exposed to diurnal and nocturnal visitors varied among traits and populations, but the direction of selection was consistent. The results suggest that diurnal pollinators are more important than nocturnal pollinators for seed production in the study populations, but that both categories contribute to selection on floral morphology. The study illustrates how experimental manipulations can link specific categories of pollinators to observed selection on floral traits, and thus improve our understanding of how species interactions shape patterns of selection.},

Previous investigations of herring gulls in the Great Lakes demonstrated elevated DNA mutation rates near steel mills (3, 4) but could not determine the importance of airborne or aquatic routes of contaminant exposure, or eliminate possible confounding factors such as nutritional status and disease burden. To address these issues experimentally, we exposed laboratory mice in situ to ambient air in a polluted industrial area near steel mills. Heritable mutation frequency at tandem-repeat DNA loci in mice exposed 1 km downwind from two integrated steel mills was 1.5- to 2.0-fold elevated compared with those at a reference site 30 km away. This statistically significant elevation was due primarily to an increase in mutations inherited through the paternal germline. Our results indicate that human and wildlife populations in proximity to integrated steel mills may be at risk of developing germline mutations more frequently because of the inhalation of airborne chemical mutagens.},

abstract = {The evolution of floral traits may be shaped by a community of floral visitors that affect plant fitness, including pollinators and floral antagonists. The role of nectar in attracting pollinators has been extensively studied, but its effects on floral antagonists are less understood. Furthermore, the composition of non-sugar nectar components, such as secondary compounds, may affect plant reproduction via changes in both pollinator and floral antagonist behavior. We manipulated the nectar alkaloid gelsemine in wild plants of the native perennial vine Gelsemium sempervirens. We crossed nectar gelsemine manipulations with a hand-pollination treatment, allowing us to determine the effect of both the trait and the interaction on plant female reproduction. We measured pollen deposition, pollen removal, and nectar robbing to assess whether gelsemine altered the behavior of mutualists and antagonists. High nectar gelsemine reduced conspecific pollen receipt by nearly half and also reduced the proportion of conspecific pollen grains received, but had no effect on nectar robbing. Although high nectar gelsemine reduced pollen removal, an estimate of male reproduction, by one-third, this effect was not statistically significant. Fruit set was limited by pollen receipt. However, this effect varied across sites such that the sites that were most pollen-limited were also the sites where nectar alkaloids had the least effect on pollen receipt, resulting in no significant effect of nectar alkaloids on fruit set. Finally, high nectar gelsemine significantly reduced seed weight; however, this effect was mediated by a mechanism other than pollen limitation. Taken together, our work suggests that nectar alkaloids are more costly than beneficial in our system, and that relatively small-scale spatial variation in trait effects and interactions could determine the selective impacts of traits such as nectar composition.},

We used quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to discover genomic regions controlling a large number of morphological traits that have diverged in parallel between pairs of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus species complex) in Paxton and Priest lakes, British Columbia. We found that nearly half of QTL affected the same traits in the same direction in both species pairs. Another 40{\%} influenced a parallel phenotypic trait in one lake but not the other. The remaining 10{\%} of QTL had phenotypic effects in opposite directions in the two species pairs. Similarity in the proportional contributions of all QTL to parallel trait differences was about 0.4. Surprisingly, QTL reuse was unrelated to phenotypic effect size. Our results indicate that repeated use of the same genomic regions is a pervasive feature of parallel phenotypic adaptation, at least in sticklebacks.

abstract = {Establishing the conditions that promote the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation has long been a goal in evolutionary biology. In ecological speciation, reproductive isolation between populations evolves as a by-product of divergent selection and the resulting environment-specific adaptations. The leading genetic model of reproductive isolation predicts that hybrid inferiority is caused by antagonistic epistasis between incompatible alleles at interacting loci. The fundamental link between divergent adaptation and reproductive isolation through genetic incompatibilities has been predicted, but has not been directly demonstrated experimentally. Here we empirically tested key predictions of speciation theory by evolving the initial stages of speciation in experimental populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After replicate populations adapted to two divergent environments, we consistently observed the evolution of two forms of postzygotic isolation in hybrids: reduced rate of mitotic reproduction and reduced efficiency of meiotic reproduction. This divergent selection resulted in greater reproductive isolation than parallel selection, as predicted by the ecological speciation theory. Our experimental system allowed controlled comparison of the relative importance of ecological and genetic isolation, and we demonstrated that hybrid inferiority can be ecological and/or genetic in basis. Overall, our results show that adaptation to divergent environments promotes the evolution of reproductive isolation through antagonistic epistasis, providing evidence of a plausible common avenue to speciation and adaptive radiation in nature.},

abstract = {Fifty years after Ehrlich and Raven's seminal paper, the idea of co-evolution continues to grow as a key concept in our understanding of organic evolution. This concept has not only provided a compelling synthesis between evolutionary biology and community ecology, but has also inspired research that extends beyond its original scope. In this article, we identify unresolved questions about the co-evolutionary process and advocate for the integration of co-evolutionary research from molecular to interspecific interactions. We address two basic questions: (i) What is co-evolution and how common is it? (ii) What is the unit of co-evolution? Both questions aim to explore the heart of the co-evolutionary process. Despite the claim that co-evolution is ubiquitous, we argue that there is in fact little evidence to support the view that reciprocal natural selection and coadaptation are common in nature. We also challenge the traditional view that co-evolution only occurs between traits of interacting species. Co-evolution has the potential to explain evolutionary processes and patterns that result from intra-and intermolecular biochemical interactions within cells, intergenomic interactions (e.g. nuclear-cytoplasmic) within species, as well as intergenomic interactions mediated by phenotypic traits between species. Research that bridges across these levels of organization will help to advance our understanding of the importance of the co-evolutionary processes in shaping the diversity of life on Earth.},

F1 hybrids from the two locations displayed significant differences in dominance, suggesting that the genetic basis for variation in U(crit) differs between locations. To determine which traits evolved in conjunction with, and may underlie, differences in performance capacity we measured a suite of traits known to affect prolonged swimming performance in fish. Although some candidate traits did not evolve (standard metabolic rate and two body shape traits), multiple morphological (pectoral fin size, shape, and four body shape measures) and physiological (maximum metabolic rate; MMR) traits evolved in the predicted direction in both stream-resident populations. However, data from F1 hybrids suggested that only one of these traits (MMR) had dominance effects similar to those of U(crit) in both locations. Overall, our data suggest that reductions in prolonged swimming performance were selected for in nonmigratory populations of threespine stickleback, and that decreases in MMR may mediate these reductions in performance.},

Here we report on the morphology of experimentally produced F1 hybrids between Pseudotropheus zebra and Labeotropheus fuelleborni two common Lake Malawi rock-dwelling haplochromine taxa (mbuna) that differ substantially in trophic morphology. We qualitatively describe the morphology of hybrids, and quantitatively analyze 13 descriptors of oral morphology using both univariate and multivariate procedures. Hybrids, although morphologically distinct, more closely resemble P. zebra than L. fuelleborni. Three individual oral jaw characters are intermediate in, and thus diagnostic of, hybrids; however, hybrids display unique patterns of expression for five characters. Discriminant function and canonical variates analysis clearly separate all three groups. The position of hybrids along canonical variate II suggests that hybrids are neither intermediate nor mosaic but rather display a novel multivariate phenotype. Our results suggest that (1) interspecific hybridization between these taxa does not occur under current conditions in Lake Malawi, (2) the genetic control of mbuna trophic morphology may involve a significant dominance component, and (3) hybrids (when produced) may lie along an ecomorphological trajectory distinct from that separating parents. As a consequence, we propose that phenotypic shifts in cichlid populations may be discontinuous and involve limited regulatory genetic change and that hybridization (if of historical importance) could result in the production of novel phenotypes with unique evolutionary potentials.},

The compilation of previously published (and often incomplete) data on evolutionary relationships of species into a composite phylogeny of the taxa in a forest, through such programs as Phylomatic, has proven useful in building community phylogenies although often of limited resolution. Recently, DNA barcodes have been used to construct a robust community phylogeny for nearly 300 tree species in a forest dynamics plot in Panama using a supermatrix method. In that study sequence data from three barcode loci were used to generate a well-resolved species-level phylogeny.},

Although the study is focused on hummingbird-pollinated plants (241 plant species), plants with different pollinator syndromes (48 species) are also included in the analyses. Nectar volume secreted in a given time period (usually 24 h) by a given flower, its sugar concentration and corolla length were compiled mainly from the literature. Altitude was also obtained from the original references. Sugar production was computed basically as the product of nectar secretion and sugar concentration, and expressed on a per 24-h basis. All nectar traits and corolla length (all log transformed), as well as altitude, showed statistically significant phylogenetic signal. Both nonphylogenetic and phylogenetically informed (independent contrasts) analyses indicated a highly significant positive correlation between corolla length and both nectar volume and sugar production. In addition, altitude (which is partially a surrogate for temperature) was significantly negatively correlated with both sugar concentration and production. Possible reasons for coadaptation of nectar production and sugar production with corolla length are discussed.},

In the total of 19 alleles sequenced in the three species, 29 non-synonymous substitutions and six indels were found in the coding region; most of amino acid substitutions (26 of 29) and all indels occurred in the C-terminal hydrophilic domain of the encoded protein. All species were polymorphic for some non-synonymous substitutions, V. unijuga was also polymorphic for one and P. sativum for two indels. Three near-isogenic lines of P. sativum bearing different alleles showed differences in many quantitative traits; that in the growth dynamic could be tentatively attributed to the allelic substitution of subtype H1-6. The frequencies of four electromorphs in a sampled locality of V. unijuga were found to be close to those observed 25 years ago, although their rapid change in the past was supposed in the previous study.},

We tested this hypothesis by reexamining Robert Whittaker's 1963 plant transect in the Santa Catalina Mountains of southern Arizona, finding that this process is already well underway. Our survey, five decades after Whittaker's, reveals large changes in the elevational ranges of common montane plants, while mean annual rainfall has decreased over the past 20 years, and mean annual temperatures increased 0.25°C/decade from 1949 to 2011 in the Tucson Basin. Although elevational changes in species are individualistic, significant overall upward movement of the lower elevation boundaries, and elevational range contractions, have occurred. This is the first documentation of significant upward shifts of lower elevation range boundaries in Southwestern montane plant species over decadal time, confirming that previous hypotheses are correct in their prediction that mountain communities in the Southwest will be strongly impacted by warming, and that the Southwest is already experiencing a rapid vegetation change.},

abstract = {Plants protect themselves against herbivory using a continuum of strategies, ranging from constitutive defenses to intermittent induced responses. Induced defenses may not provide immediate and maximum protection, but could be advantageous when continuous defense is either energetically or ecologically costly. As such, induced defenses in flowers could help defend relatively valuable tissue while keeping reproductive structures accessible and attractive to pollinators. Thus far, no one has demonstrated the efficacy of induced defenses against floral herbivores (florivores) in the field. Here we show that mechanical leaf damage in wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata (Solanaceae), reduced both flower and fruit herbivory in the field and that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate, a potent elicitor of induced responses, reduced both leaf and floral damage in natural populations. This result is consistent with a survey of damage in the field, which showed a negative relationship between leaf damage and flower and fruit damage. Although optimal defense theory predicts that induced defenses should be rare in reproductive tissues, owing to their high fitness value, our results suggest otherwise. Induced defenses in leaves and reproductive tissues may allow plants to respond effectively to the concomitant pressures of defending against herbivory and attracting pollinators.},

Divergent pollinator preferences are believed to be in part responsible for their reproductive isolation. The volume of nectar produced and several components of flower morphology might contribute to pollinator-dependant reproductive isolation. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic changes underlying the quantitative differences observed between these two Petunia species in flower size and nectar volume. We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for the different phenotypes of P. axillaris and P. integrifolia in an inter-specific backcross population. QTL of small to moderate effect control the differences in flower size and volume of nectar. In addition, we observed strong suppression of meiotic recombination in Petunia, even between closely related species, which precluded a fine resolution of QTL mapping. Thus, our data suggest that flower size and nectar volume are highly polygenic. They are likely to have evolved gradually through pollinator-mediated adaptation or reinforcement, and are not likely to have been primary factors in early steps of pollinator isolation of P. axillaris and P. integrifolia.},

abstract = {Research on herbivore-induced plant defence and research on pollination ecology have had a long history of separation. Plant reproduction of most angiosperm species is mediated by pollinators, and the effects of herbivore-induced plant defences on pollinator behaviour have been largely neglected. Moreover, there is expected to be a trade-off between plant reproductive strategies and defence mechanisms. To investigate this trade-off, it is essential to study herbivore-induced plant resistance and allocation of resources by plants, within the same system, and to test if indirect plant resistance can conflict with pollinator attraction. Here, I review the key literature highlighting connection between plant defence and reproduction, and propose to exploit natural variation among plant species to assess the ecological costs of plant responses to herbivores and pollinators. It is crucial to study herbivore-induced resistance and resource allocation by plants within the same study system.There is a need to link the study of herbivore-induced responses with that of plant-pollinator associations, and ultimately to plant fitness.Focussing on the underlying mechanisms of plant responses to herbivory and pollination will help to understand if and how the attraction of carnivores can conflict with the attraction of pollinators.The use of natural variation in plant species will allow the assessment of the ecological costs associated with plant responses to herbivores and pollinators.},

abstract = {Satial prediction of coral reef habitats and coral reef community components was approached on the basis of the ‘predict first, classify later' paradigm. Individual community components (biotic and geomorphologic bottom features) were first predicted and then classified into composite habitats. This approach differs from widely applied methods of direct classification based on remote sensing only. In situ coral reef community-condition assessment was first used to measure a response variable (percentage cover of habitat). Reef bottom features (topographic complexity, sand-sediment, rock-calcareous pavement and rubble) were then predicted using generalized additive models (GAMs) applied to continuous environmental maps, high-resolution Ikonos satellite images and a reef digital topographic model (DTM). Next, using GAMs on newly created bottom maps, models were fitted to predict coral community components (hard coral, sea-grass, algae, octocorals). At this stage, high-resolution maps of the geomorphologic and biotic components of the coral reef community at an experimental site (Akumal Reef in the Mexican Caribbean) were produced. Coral reef habitat maps were derived using GIS following a hierarchical classification procedure, and the resulting merged map depicting 8 habitats was compared against thematic maps created by traditional supervised classification. This general approach sets a baseline for future studies involving more complex spatial and ecological predictions on coral reefs.},

abstract = {Hybridization may influence evolution in a variety of ways. If hybrids are less fit, the geographical range of ecologically divergent populations may be limited, and prezygotic reproductive isolation may be reinforced. If some hybrid genotypes are fitter than one or both parents, at least in some environments, then hybridization could make a positive contribution. Single alleles that are at an advantage in the alternative environment and genetic background will introgress readily, although such introgression may be hard to detect. 'Hybrid speciation', in which fit combinations of alleles are established, is more problematic; its likelihood depends on how divergent populations meet, and on the structure of epistasis. These issues are illustrated using Fisher's model of stabilizing selection on multiple traits, under which reproductive isolation evolves as a side-effect of adaptation in allopatry. This confirms a priori arguments that while recombinant hybrids are less fit on average, some gene combinations may be fitter than the parents, even in the parental environment. Fisher's model does predict heterosis in diploid F1s, asymmetric incompatibility in reciprocal backcrosses, and (when dominance is included) Haldane's Rule. However, heterosis arises only when traits are additive, whereas the latter two patterns require dominance. Moreover, because adaptation is via substitutions of small effect, Fisher's model does not generate the strong effects of single chromosome regions often observed in species crosses.},

abstract = {Herbivores can consume significant amounts of plant biomass in many environments. Yet plants are not defenseless against such attack. Although defenses might benefit plants in the presence of herbivores, herbivore attack varies both spatially and temporally, and the expression of plant resistance to herbivores can be costly in the absence of plant enemies. Costs can be described as allocation costs, resource-based tradeoffs between resistance and fitness, or as ecological costs, decreases in fitness resulting from interactions with other species. Here, we update the seminal 1996 Bergelson and Purrington review of resistance costs and find that many more studies have documented costs of resistance (sensu lato) than found during the 1996 survey. Eighty-two percent of studies in which genetic background is controlled, demonstrate significant fitness reductions associated with herbivore resistance. We categorize studies by type of resistance, induced or constitutive, by type of cost, and also by the degree to which investigators controlled for genetic background. Recent work has commonly detected both direct resistance costs, such as resource-based tradeoffs, and ecological costs, which depend on interactions with other species.},

From North to South, and from high to low elevation there was a transition from G. c. costae-like phenotypes to phenotypes resembling pure G. c. fieberi. The same pattern was confirmed with canonical variate analysis not taking geographic location into account; it is therefore not an artifact of trend surface analysis. Comparisons of the pattern of morphometric variation of laboratory-reared offspring with the pattern of their parents sampled from natural populations show that geographic variation is mostly determined genetically. Intermediate individuals from field populations probably are natural hybrids between the two subspecies, because laboratory-reared hybrids were intermediate between the offspring of pure strains. We did not find increased morphometric variation within the contact zone. This suggests unimpeded introgression and is in contrast with an increase in size variability that is predicted to be associated with a transition between uni- and bivoltine forms.},

abstract = {Hybridisation and introgression can dramatically alter the relationships among groups of species, leading to phylogenetic discordance across the genome and between populations. Introgression can also erode species differences over time, but selection against introgression at certain loci acts to maintain postmating species barriers. Theory predicts that species barriers made up of many loci throughout the genome should lead to a broad correlation between introgression and recombination rate, which determines the extent to which selection on deleterious foreign alleles will affect neutral alleles at physically linked loci. Here, we describe the variation in genealogical relationships across the genome among three species of Heliconius butterflies: H. melpomene (mel), H. cydno (cyd), and H. timareta (tim), using whole genomes of 92 individuals, and ask whether this variation can be explained by heterogeneous barriers to introgression. We find that species relationships vary predictably at the chromosomal scale. By quantifying recombination rate and admixture proportions, we then show that rates of introgression are predicted by variation in recombination rate. This implies that species barriers are highly polygenic, with selection acting against introgressed alleles across most of the genome. In addition, long chromosomes, which have lower recombination rates, produce stronger barriers on average than short chromosomes. Finally, we find a consistent difference between two species pairs on either side of the Andes, which suggests differences in the architecture of the species barriers. Our findings illustrate how the combined effects of hybridisation, recombination, and natural selection, acting at multitudes of loci over long periods, can dramatically sculpt the phylogenetic relationships among species.},

abstract = {Because adaptation depends upon the fixation of novel beneficial mutations, the fitness effects of beneficial mutations that are substituted by selection are key to our understanding of the process of adaptation. In this study, we experimentally investigated the fitness effects of beneficial mutations that are substituted when populations of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapt to the antibiotic rifampicin. Specifically, we isolated the first beneficial mutation to be fixed by selection when 96 populations of three different genotypes of P. aeruginosa that vary considerably in fitness in the presence of rifampicin were challenged with adapting to a high dose of this antibiotic. The simple genetics of rifampicin resistance allowed us to determine the genetic basis of adaptation in the majority of our populations. We show that the average fitness effects of fixed beneficial mutations show a simple and clear pattern of diminishing returns, such that selection tends to fix mutations with progressively smaller effects as populations approach a peak on the adaptive landscape. The fitness effects of individual mutations, on the other hand, are highly idiosyncratic across genetic backgrounds, revealing pervasive epistasis. In spite of this complexity of genetic interactions in this system, there is an overall tendency toward diminishing-returns epistasis. We argue that a simple overall pattern of diminishing-returns adaptation emerges, despite pervasive epistasis between beneficial mutations, because many beneficial mutations are available, and while the fitness landscape is rugged at the fine scale, it is smooth and regular when we consider the average over possible routes to adaptation. In the context of antibiotic resistance, these results show that acquiring mutations that confer low levels of antibiotic resistance does not impose any constraint on the ability to evolve high levels of resistance.},

abstract = {Parallel speciation occurs when selection drives repeated, independent adaptive divergence that reduces gene flow between ecotypes. Classical examples show parallel speciation originating from shared genomic variation, but this does not seem to be the case in the rough periwinkle (Littorina saxatilis) that has evolved considerable phenotypic diversity across Europe, including several distinct ecotypes. Small 'wave' ecotype snails inhabit exposed rocks and experience strong wave action, while thick-shelled, 'crab' ecotype snails are larger and experience crab predation on less exposed shores. Crab and wave ecotypes appear to have arisen in parallel and recent evidence suggests only marginal sharing of molecular variation linked to evolution of similar ecotypes in different parts of Europe. However the extent of genomic sharing is expected to increase with gene flow and more recent common ancestry. To test this we used de novo RAD-sequencing to quantify the extent of shared genomic divergence associated with phenotypic similarities among ecotype-pairs on three close islands ({\textless} 10 km distance) connected by weak gene flow (Nm{\~{}}0.03) and with recent common ancestry ({\textless} 10,000 years). After accounting for technical issues, including a large proportion of null alleles due to a large effective population size, we found {\~{}}8-28{\%} of positive outliers were shared between two islands and {\~{}}2-9{\%} were shared among all three islands. This low level of sharing suggests that parallel phenotypic divergence in this system is not matched by shared genomic divergence despite a high probability of gene flow and standing genetic variation.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG. Differences in herbivore resistance between parental and hybrid taxa influence the trajectories of hybrid swarms and may lead to the maintenance or breakdown of species boundaries. In the present study, phytochemical patterns in terms of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and tannins in three central European representatives of the Senecio nemorensis syngameon (i.e., S. germanicus, S. hercynicus, S. ovatus) were inferred and the selective consumption among the pure species and among the pure species and their reciprocal hybrids was studied in food-choice (‘cafeteria') experiments using two mollusc species. The results show significant qualitative and quantitative differences in chemical composition among the three plant species. Artificial F 1  hybrids of the two investigated plant systems S. germanicus–S. ovatus and S. hercynicus–S. ovatus mainly expressed an additive PA pattern compared to the parental taxa. PA concentration was highest in S. hercynicus, intermediate in S. ovatus and lowest in S. germanicus, while tannin concentration was lower in S. hercynicus compared to S. ovatus and S. germanicus. Food-choice experiments revealed significant plant species-specific preferences exhibited by the two mollusc species (the slug Arion fuscus and the snail Trochulus striolatus danubialis). Consistent negative correlations between the total PA concentration and the consumed leaf area were only observed for the snail, but not for the slug species. When reciprocal hybrid taxa were added to the food-choice designs, the plant taxon-specific differences in consumption disappeared. Additionally, no significant effect of tannin concentration on strength of herbivory was observed. The present results of food-choice experiments in three representatives of the S. nemorensis syngameon, therefore, demonstrate that PAs rather than tannins influence taxon-specific herbivory by molluscs. However, they also suggest that trajectories of mixed stands and hybrid swarms in the wild could be more pronouncedly determined by the local composition of mollusc communities, the frequency of intermediate chemotypes (hybrids), and other factors (e.g., morphology, other biotic and abiotic conditions).},

abstract = {Simple and ubiquitous gene interactions create rugged fitness landscapes composed of coadapted gene complexes separated by "valleys" of low fitness. Crossing such fitness valleys allows a population to escape suboptimal local fitness peaks to become better adapted. This is the premise of Sewall Wright's shifting balance process. Here we generalize the theory of fitness-valley crossing in the two-locus, bi-allelic case by allowing bias in parent-offspring transmission. This generalization extends the existing mathematical framework to genetic systems with segregation distortion and uniparental inheritance. Our results are also flexible enough to provide insight into shifts between alternate stable states in cultural systems with "transmission valleys". Using a semi-deterministic analysis and a stochastic diffusion approximation, we focus on the limiting step in valley crossing: the first appearance of the genotype on the new fitness peak whose lineage will eventually fix. We then apply our results to specific cases of segregation distortion, uniparental inheritance, and cultural transmission. Segregation distortion favouring mutant alleles facilitates crossing most when recombination and mutation are rare, i.e., scenarios where crossing is otherwise unlikely. Interactions with more mutable genes (e.g., uniparental inherited cytoplasmic elements) substantially reduce crossing times. Despite component traits being passed on poorly in the previous cultural background, small advantages in the transmission of a new combination of cultural traits can greatly facilitate a cultural transition. While peak shifts are unlikely under many of the common assumptions of population genetic theory, relaxing some of these assumptions can promote fitness-valley crossing.},

abstract = {Several prominent hypotheses have been posed to explain the immense variability among plant species in defense against herbivores. A major concept in the evolutionary ecology of plant defenses is that tradeoffs of defense strategies are likely to generate and maintain species diversity. In particular, tradeoffs between constitutive and induced resistance and tradeoffs relating these strategies to growth and competitive ability have been predicted. We performed three independent experiments on 58 plant species from 15 different plant families to address these hypotheses in a phylogenetic framework. Because evolutionary tradeoffs may be altered by human-imposed artificial selection, we used 18 wild plant species and 40 cultivated garden-plant species. Across all 58 plant species, we demonstrate a tradeoff between constitutive and induced resistance, which was robust to accounting for phylogenetic history of the species. Moreover, the tradeoff was driven by wild species and was not evident for cultivated species. In addition, we demonstrate that more competitive species-but not fast growing ones-had lower constitutive but higher induced resistance. Thus, our multispecies experiments indicate that the competition-defense tradeoff holds for constitutive resistance and is complemented by a positive relationship of competitive ability with induced resistance. We conclude that the studied genetically determined tradeoffs are indeed likely to play an important role in shaping the high diversity observed among plant species in resistance against herbivores and in life history traits.},

abstract = {Multivariate statistical methods are derived for measuring selection solely from observed changes in the distribution of phenotypic characters in a population within a generation. Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Polyploids are often hypothesized to have distinct and broader niches than their diploid progenitors. Differences in geographic distributions between diploid and polyploids are frequently used to infer niche differentiation and increased breadth, but they are seldom used to test these hypotheses explicitly.

METHODS: Niche overlap and breadth were compared for diploids, tetraploids, and hexaploids of three taxa in the Claytonia perfoliata complex (C. parviflora, C. perfoliata, and C. rubra) with the use of species distribution models. Resampling and randomization approaches were used to test hypotheses of niche differentiation, breadth, and conservatism.

KEY RESULTS: Niche differentiation was detected between polyploid and diploid cytotypes assigned to the same taxon (e.g., C. parviflora 2× vs. 4×) but not between hexaploids and tetraploids within a taxon (e.g., C. parviflora 4× vs. 6×). Individual hexaploid cytotypes had broader ecological niches than individual diploid cytotypes. However, as a group the three hexaploid taxa did not exceed the combined niche breadth of the three diploids, suggesting that polyploidy does not result in transgressive niche breadth for this group. Niche overlap was lowest among diploids and was highest among the three hexaploid cytotypes, consistent with introgression associated with polyploidy resulting in greater ecological similarity. Although cytotypes possessed nonidentical niches, after accounting for environmental differences among ranges, cytotypes were more similar than expected, suggesting niche conservatism and similar responses to environmental characteristics.

CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that polyploids occupy distinct and broader niches relative to diploids but that cytotypes also share fundamentally similar responses to environmental variation across ploidy levels.},

abstract = {Biochemical pathways that produce floral pigments often also produce secondary compounds that are believed to protect plants from natural enemies. Mutations that affect floral pigment patterns are thus also expected to influence the production of compounds conferring resistance to natural enemies, suggesting that the evolution of floral pigment patterns may be guided not just by interactions with pollinators, but also by indirect selection exerted by enemies on resistance. In particular, mutations that block production of floral pigments may be expected either to block production of defensive compounds or, alternatively, to lead to increased production of defenses, depending on the position of the blockage in the pathway. This expectation was examined in the morning glory Ipomoea purpurea by assessing whether white-flowered genotypes are more or less susceptible to attack by natural enemies than pigmented genotypes. No such difference in susceptibility was detected, although resistance to capsule-feeding insects exhibited a pigment genotype X background genotype interaction. While this negative result indicates that natural enemies probably do not influence the evolution of floral pigment pattern in I. purpurea, this remains a possibility in other systems.},

abstract = {Hypothesis: Interspecific hybrids are competitively inferior to their parents because they possess intermediate phenotypes that are poorly adapted to either parent's niche. Organisms: Spadefoot toads, Spea multiplicata and S. bombifrons. Methods: Where they co-occur, tadpoles of S. multiplicata and S. bombifrons specialize on different resources (detritus and anostracan fairy shrimp, respectively). This pattern reflects ecological character displacement promoting divergence in resource use to minimize resource competition between these species. We asked whether hybrids between these species are competitively inferior for parental resources. We used a paired design to measure growth of hybrid tadpoles in the laboratory when reared in competition with pure-species tadpoles (the experimental treatment) versus when reared with siblings (the control). In separate tests we also measured: (1) foraging behaviour of hybrid and pure-species tadpoles; (2) facultative shifts in foraging behaviour by hybrids; and (3) competitive ability for the resource (shrimp) on which S. bombifrons tadpoles specialize. Results: Hybrid tadpoles grew as well or better when reared in competition with pure-species tadpoles than when reared with siblings. In terms of foraging behaviour, hybrid tadpoles exhibited a wider range of phenotypes than either pure-species type. Hybrids therefore may be able to utilize resources of both parent species. Generally, the occurrence of novel hybrid phenotypes could prevent speciation if, contrary to the ecological selection hypothesis, the greater range in hybrid phenotypes enables them to occupy both parents' niches.},

abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category-subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods - both sample-based and individual-based - allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

Numerical results obtained on a single locus model as well as a polygenic simulation model demonstrate that an environmental difference may trigger genetic divergence of flowering time. This divergence results because there is non-random migration with respect to flowering time, which has effects like those demonstrated by Thoday and Gibson (1970) in an experiment in which selective migration alone gave genetic divergence between habitats with respect to sternopleural bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster. In view of the results it is suggested that the evolution of reproductive isolation may sometimes start through a selectively neutral process, which can secondarily enhance the adaptation to divergent selection regimes in adjacent plant populations.},

abstract = {Animals pollinate 87{\%} of the world's flowering plant species. Therefore, how pollinators respond to human-induced land-use change has important implications for plants and the species that depend on them. Here, we synthesize the published literature on how land-use change affects the main groups of pollinators: bees, butterflies, flies, birds, and bats. Responses to land-use change are predominantly negative but are highly variable within and across taxa. The directionality of pollinator response varies according to study design, with comparisons across gradients in surrounding landscape cover finding largely negative responses and comparisons across local land-use types finding largely positive responses. Furthermore, among the studies using landscape designs, most were performed in systems where land-use change is extreme, and such studies find stronger negative effects than those performed in more moderate systems. Across multiple taxa, dietary specialists show greater sensitivity to land use than do generalists. There is a need for studies of pollinator species composition and relative abundance, rather than simply species richness and aggregate abundance, to identify the species that are lost and gained with increasing land-use change.},

abstract = {Due to its influence on body size, timing of maturation is an important life-history trait in ectotherms with indeterminate growth. Comparison of patterns of growth and maturation within and between two populations (giant vs. normal sized) of nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) in a breeding experiment revealed that the difference in mean adult body size between the populations is caused by differences in timing of maturation, and not by differential growth rates. The fish in small-sized population matured earlier than those from large-sized population, and maturation was accompanied by a reduction in growth rate in the small-sized population. Males matured earlier and at smaller size than females, and the fish that were immature at the end of the experiment were larger than those that had already matured. Throughout the experimental period, body size in both populations was heritable (h(2) = 0.10-0.64), as was the timing of maturation in the small-sized population (h(2) = 0.13-0.16). There was a significant positive genetic correlation between body size and timing of maturation at 140 DAH, but not earlier (at 80 or 110 DAH). Comparison of observed body size divergence between the populations revealed that Q(ST) exceeded F(ST) at older ages, indicating adaptive basis for the observed divergence. Hence, the results suggest that the body size differences within and between populations reflect heritable genetic differences in the timing of maturation, and that the observed body size divergence is adaptive.},

abstract = {Since 1983, study of natural selection has relied heavily on multiple regression of fitness on the values for a set of traits via ordinary least squares (OLSs), as proposed by Lande and Arnold, to obtain an estimate of the quadratic relationship between fitness and the traits, the fitness surface. However, well-known statistical problems with this approach can affect inferences about selection. One key concern is that measures of lifetime fitness do not conform to a normal or any other standard sampling distribution, as needed to justify the usual statistical tests. Another is that OLS may yield an estimate of the sign of the fitness function's curvature that is opposite to the truth. We here show that the recently developed aster modeling approach, which explicitly models the components of fitness as the basis for inferences about lifetime fitness, eliminates these problems. We illustrate selection analysis via aster using simulated datasets involving five fitness components expressed in each of four years. We demonstrate that aster analysis yields accurate estimates of the fitness function in cases in which OLS misleads, as well as accurate confidence regions for directional selection gradients. Further, to evaluate selection when many traits are under consideration, we recommend model selection by information criteria and frequentist model averaging.},

abstract = {Ecology affects each of the three principal processes leading to speciation: genetic differentiation among populations within species, acquisition of reproductive isolation among populations, and the rise of ecological differentiation among such populations, allowing them to coexist. Until recently, however, the ties between ecology and speciation in plants have received relatively little attention. This paper reviews some exciting new insights into the role of ecology in speciation, focusing on the angiosperms. I consider five main topics, including (1) the determinants of the spatial scale of genetic differentiation within spe- cies; (2) the role and limits of adaptive radiation in increasing net rates of plant diversification; (3) the potential role of ecological speciation; (4) the contributions of hybridiz a tion to speciation, adaptive radiation, and the ecological breadth of clades; and (5) the ecological determi nants of net diversification rate for individual lineages, and of the species richness for regional floras. Limited dispersal, especially of seeds, favors genetic differentiation at small spatial scales and is likely to foster rapid spe- ciation and narrow endemism. Meta-analyses show that the minimum area required for in situ speciation on islands increases with the spatial scale of gene flow in various organ isms. In angiosperms, fleshy fruits dispersed by vertebrates often increase the distance over which seeds are dispersed, but can decrease it in forest understor ies. Nutrient-poor soils should work against the evolution of fleshy fruits and promote speciation and narrow endemism. Selection for adaptation to different conditions drives adaptive radiation, the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and attendant adaptations within a lineage. On islands, adaptive radiation often leads to woodiness, monocarpy, developmental heterophylly, and sexual dimorphism, as well as differences in habitat, growth form, and floral morphology. Adaptive radia- tion appears to accel erate speciation in only some plant clades. Extensive radiation in some lineages has been ascribed to early colonization, large amounts of heritable genetic vari ation, “genetic lines of least resist ance” upon which selection could act, absence of potential competi tors, and possession of “key innova tions” that provide access to novel resources. To these should be added large island area, organ ismal abundance, saturation of ecological space, and the synergism action of limited dispersal and divergent selection producing parallel radiations in isolated regions. Data for Hawaiian lobeliads suggest that within-island species richness of Cyanea—involving diverg ence in elevation and flower tube length—saturates within 0.6 and 1.5 Ma. Adaptive radiation in pollinators is an important mechanism of ecological speciation: adaptation to different pollinators leads to pollinator partitioning and reproductive isolation. Selection for longer nectar spurs and pollinator mouth parts led to increased speciation in Aquilegia and other groups. A similar process may work once tubu lar flowers evolve from cup-shaped blossoms. Selection for floral divergence may be limited in forest understories illuminated by dim, greenish light, which may account for the predomin ance of small, visually inconspicuous flowers in temperate and tropical understory species. Hybridization can stimulate speciation by forming trans gress ive phenotypes that exceed the range seen in parental taxa, and by introgressing adaptive gene combi nations. The likelihood of transgressive phenotypes increases with the genetic diver- gence between parental taxa, so speciation via transgressive hybridization may be most likely among taxa with inter med iate amounts of divergence. Several large adaptive radiations appear to have occurred after hybridization, suggesting a special role for the extensive amount of genetic variation that can be supplied and refreshed by syngameons. Rates of net species diversification are greater in herbs (especially annuals) vs. woody plants; in animal- vs. wind-pollinated species; in plants with poorly dispersed seeds; in families with a greater diversity of growth forms, pollination and seed disper- sal mechanisms, and species distributions; in families at lower latitudes; in families with higher rates of genetic evolution; in hermaphroditic or monoecious vs. dioecious clades; in earlier-maturing woody plants; in plants with bilateral vs. radial flowers; in plants with hummingbird-pollinated flowers; in epiphytic vs. terrestrial bromeliads and orchids; in bromeliads differentiating along geographically extensive cordilleras; and in young vs. old clades. Evidence for the last pattern may, however, be an artifact of (auto)regressing (ln N) / t vs. t. High rates of diversification in epiphytic orchids are tied to small effective population sizes, suggesting a role for intermittent genetic drift alternating with strong selection on floral traits. Across angiosperms, a massive increase in diversification rates was preceded by a major increase in leaf vein density and hydraulic conductance between 140 and 110 Ma ago, leading to higher photosynthetic rates than coexisting ferns and gymnosperms. Based on the economic theory of plant defense, this should have led to lower allocation to anti-herbivore defenses, selecting for low-cost qualitative toxins rather than all-purpose but highly expensive qualitative defenses, triggering an arms' race between angiosperm and their herbivores. Finally, regional plant species richness increases with regional area and proxies for latitude, rainfall, topo graphic heterogeneity, and vegetation stratification. The Cape Floristic Province has roughly twice as many species as expected from its area and environmental conditions, most likely reflecting the predomi n ance of short-distance dispersal associated with poor soils and myrmecochory in the Cape Province, as well as low rates of regeneration and competitive exclusion following fire.},

Leaf traits chosen were those that show pronounced differences between the original parents, including leaf size, shape, orientation, color, structure, petiole size, and petiole cross section. Leaves were sampled from the current terminal, proleptic, and sylleptic branches. In the F2 generation, leaf traits were all significantly different among genotypes, but with significant effects due to genotype X crown-position interaction. Variation in leaf pigmentation, petiole length. And petiole length proportion appeared to be under the control of few quantitative trait loci (QTLs). More QTLs were associated with single leaf area, leaf shape, lamina angle, abaxial color, and petiole flatness, and in these traits the number of QTLs varied among crown positions. In general, the estimates of QTL numbers from Wright's biometric method were close to those derived from molecular markers. For those traits with few underlying QTLs, a single marker interval could explain from 30 to 60{\%} of the observed phenotypic variance. For multigenic traits, certain markers contributed more substantially to the observed variation than others. Genetic cluster analysis showed developmentally related traits to be more strongly associated with each other than with unrelated traits. This finding was also supported by the QTL mapping. For example, the same chromosomal segment of linkage group L seemed to account for 20{\%} of the phenotypic variation of all dimension-related traits, leaf size, petiole length. and midrib angle. In both traits. the P. deltoides alleles had positive effects and were dominant to the P. trichocarpa alleles. Similar relationships were also found for lamina angle. abaxial greenness, and petiole.},

abstract = {Background. Zones of contact between closely related taxa with divergent migratory routes, termed migratory divides, have been suggested as areas where hybrid offspring may have intermediate and inferior migratory routes, resulting in low fitness of hybrids and thereby promoting speciation. In the Rocky Mountains of Canada there is a narrow hybrid zone between Audubon's and myrtle warblers that is likely maintained by selection against hybrids. Band recoveries and isotopic studies indicate that this hybrid zone broadly corresponds to the location of a possible migratory divide, with Audubon's warblers migrating south-southwest and myrtle warblers migrating southeast.Wetested a key prediction of the migratory divide hypothesis: that genetic background would be predictive of migratory orientation among warblers in the center of the hybrid zone. Methods. We recorded fall migratory orientation of wild-caught migrating warblers in the center of the hybrid zone as measured by video-based monitoring of migratory restlessness in circular orientation chambers. We then tested whether there was a relationship between migratory orientation and genetic background, as measured using a set of species-specific diagnostic genetic markers. Results. We did not detect a significant association between orientation and genetic background. There was large variation among individuals in orientation direction. Meanorientation was towards the NE, surprising for birds on fall migration, but aligned with the mountain valley in which the study took place. Conclusions. Only one other study has directly analyzed migratory orientation among naturally-produced hybrids in a migratory divide. While the other study showed an association between genetic background and orientation, we did not observe such an association in yellow-rumped warblers. We discuss possible reasons, including the possibility of a lack of a strong migratory divide in this hybrid zone and/or methodological limitations that may have prevented accurate measurements of long- distance migratory orientation.},

abstract = {Aim  We assess the realism of bioclimate envelope model projections for anticipated future climates by validating ecosystem reconstructions for the late Quaternary with fossil and pollen data. Specifically, we ask: (1) do climate conditions with no modern analogue negatively affect the accuracy of ecosystem reconstructions? (2) are bioclimate envelope model projections biased towards under-predicting forested ecosystems? (3) given a palaeoecological perspective, are potential habitat projections for the 21st century within model capabilities? Location  Western North America. Methods  We used an ensemble classifier modelling approach (RandomForest) to spatially project the climate space of modern ecosystem classes throughout the Holocene (at 6000, 9000, 11,000, 14,000, 16,000, and 21,000 YBP) using palaeoclimate surfaces generated by two general circulation models (GFDL and CCM1). The degree of novel arrangement of climate variables was quantified with the multivariate Mahalanobis distance to the nearest modern climatic equivalent. Model projections were validated against biome classifications inferred from 1460 palaeoecological records. Results  Model accuracy assessed against independent palaeoecology data is generally low for the present day, increases for 6000 YBP, and then rapidly declines towards the last glacial maximum, primarily due to the under-prediction of forested biomes. Misclassifications were closely correlated with the degree of climate dissimilarity from the present day. For future projections, no-analogue climates unexpectedly emerged in the coastal Pacific Northwest but were absent throughout the rest of the study area. Main conclusions  Bioclimate envelope models could approximately reconstruct ecosystem distributions for the mid- to late-Holocene but proved unreliable in the Late Pleistocene. We attribute this failure to a combination of no-analogue climates and a potential lack of niche conservatism in tree species. However, climate dissimilarities in future projections are comparatively minor (similar to those of the mid-Holocene), and we conclude that no-analogue climates should not compromise the accuracy of model predictions for the next century.},

Because many modern trees display adaptive differentiation in relation to latitude or elevation, it is likely that ancient trees were also so differentiated, with environmental sensitivities of populations throughout the range evolving in conjunction with migrations. Rapid climate changes challenge this process by imposing stronger selection and by distancing populations from environments to which they are adapted. The unprecedented rates of climate changes anticipated to occur in the future, coupled with land use changes that impede gene flow, can be expected to disrupt the interplay of adaptation and migration, likely affecting productivity and threatening the persistence of many species.},

abstract = {Research in speciation genetics has uncovered many robust patterns in intrinsic reproductive isolation, and fitness landscape models have been useful in interpreting these patterns. Here, we examine fitness landscapes based on Fisher's geometric model. Such landscapes are analogous to models of optimizing selection acting on quantitative traits, and have been widely used to study adaptation and the distribution of mutational effects. We show that, with a few modifications, Fisher's model can generate all of the major findings of introgression studies (including “speciation genes” with strong deleterious effects, complex epistasis and asymmetry), and the major patterns in overall hybrid fitnesses (including Haldane's Rule, the speciation clock, heterosis, hybrid breakdown, and male–female asymmetry in the F1). We compare our approach to alternative modeling frameworks that assign fitnesses to genotypes by identifying combinations of incompatible alleles. In some cases, the predictions are importantly different. For example, Fisher's model can explain conflicting empirical results about the rate at which incompatibilities accumulate with genetic divergence. In other cases, the predictions are identical. For example, the quality of reproductive isolation is little affected by the manner in which populations diverge.},

We find analytic solutions to the probability that adaptation follows a certain path during evolution as well as the probability that adaptation arrives at a given genotype regardless of the path taken. We also consider the probability of parallel adaptation and the proportion of the total increase in fitness caused by the first substitution.

Haldane and others have proposed that parallel evolution also results from a second process, the similarly biased production of genetic variation in close relatives, an idea that has received few tests. We suggest that influence of shared genetic biases should be detectable by the disproportionate use of the same genes in independent instances of parallel phenotypic evolution. We show how progress in testing this prediction can be made through simple tests of parallel inheritance of genetic differences: similar additive, dominance, and epistasis components in analysis of line means and similar effective numbers of loci. We demonstrate parallel inheritance in two traits, lateral plate number and body shape, in two lineages of threespine stickleback that have adapted independently to freshwater streams on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean. Notably, reduction of plate number in freshwater involves a substitution at the same major locus in both lineages. Our results represent only a first step in the study of the genetics of parallel phenotypic evolution in sticklebacks. Nevertheless, we have shown how such studies can be employed to test the genetic hypothesis of parallel evolution and how study of parallel evolution might yield insights into the roles of both selection and genetic constraint in phenotypic evolution.},

abstract = {Novel or changing environments expose animals to diverse stressors that likely require coordinated hormonal and behavioral adaptations. Predicted adaptations to urban environments include attenuated physiological responses to stressors and bolder exploratory behaviors, but few studies to date have evaluated the impact of urban life on codivergence of these hormonal and behavioral traits in natural systems. Here, we demonstrate rapid adaptive shifts in both stress physiology and correlated boldness behaviors in a songbird, the dark-eyed junco, following its colonization of a novel urban environment. We compared elevation in corticosterone (CORT) in response to handling and flight initiation distances in birds from a recently established urban population in San Diego, California to birds from a nearby wildland population in the species' ancestral montane breeding range. We also measured CORT and exploratory behavior in birds raised from early life in a captive common garden study. We found persistent population differences for both reduced CORT responses and bolder exploratory behavior in birds from the colonist population, as well as significant negative covariation between maximum CORT and exploratory behavior. Although early developmental effects cannot be ruled out, these results suggest contemporary adaptive evolution of correlated hormonal and behavioral traits associated with colonization of an urban habitat.},

abstract = {Since its discovery in 1907, polyploidy has been recognized as an important phenomenon in vascular plants, and several lines of evidence indicate that most, if not all, plant species ultimately have a polyploid ancestry. However, previous estimates of the frequency of polyploid speciation suggest that the formation and establishment of neopolyploid species is rare. By combining information from the botanical community's vast cytogenetic and phylogenetic databases, we establish that 15{\%} of angiosperm and 31{\%} of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase. These frequency estimates are higher by a factor of four than earlier estimates and lead to a standing incidence of polyploid species within genera of 35{\%} (n = 1,506). Despite this high incidence, we find no direct evidence that polyploid lines, once established, enjoy greater net species diversification. Thus, the widespread occurrence of polyploid taxa appears to result from the substantial contribution of polyploidy to cladogenesis, but not from subsequent increases in diversification rates of polyploid lines.},

Although Pitx1 null mutations are lethal in laboratory animals, Pitx1 regulatory mutations show molecular signatures of positive selection in pelvic-reduced populations.

processes of speciation. Sexual isolation has been shown to contribute
to speciation in many sympatric taxa; however, its role in parapatric
taxa with reduced interspecific gene flow is poorly understood. I
investigated the extent of sexual isolation in two closely related
Neotropical understory species, Costus allenii and C. villosissimus,
that occur in adjacent habitats within flight distance of their shared
pollinators, euglossine bees. Pollination arrays were used to test
whether individual pollinators travel between species, to estimate the
proportion of hetero- and conspecific pollen deposited on the stigmas,
and to examine the proportion of hybrid progeny. In comparison to C.
allenii, C. villosissimus produces flowers with larger labella, longer
stamen-labellum distances, and longer styles. Pollinators visited both
species but preferred C. villosissimus. This preference caused
pollinator isolation in C. villosissimus. In C. allenii, the frequency
of heterospecific pollinator transitions was not less common than that
of conspecific transitions, but floral mechanical isolation greatly
reduced the likelihood of heterospecific pollen deposition. The
contribution of gametic isolation was not strong in either species.
Based on data for pollinator isolation, floral mechanical isolation, and
gametic isolation, it appears that sexual isolation is weak in C.
allenii, restricting heterospecific gene flow by 25 {\%}, but moderate in
C. villosissimus, where gene flow from C. allenii is reduced by 70 {\%}.
Further research will estimate the magnitude of other isolation barriers
to determine the relative contribution of sexual isolation to total
isolation in this parapatric species pair.},

abstract = {Beneficial mutations are required for adaptation to novel environments, yet the range of mutational pathways that are available to a population has been poorly characterized, particularly in eukaryotes. We assessed the genetic changes of the first mutations acquired during adaptation to a novel environment (exposure to the fungicide, nystatin) in 35 haploid lines of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Through whole-genome resequencing we found that the genomic scope for adaptation was narrow; all adapted lines acquired a mutation in one of four late-acting genes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, with very few other mutations found. Lines that acquired different ergosterol mutations in the same gene exhibited very similar tolerance to nystatin. All lines were found to have a cost relative to wild type in an unstressful environment; the level of this cost was also strongly correlated with the ergosterol gene bearing the mutation. Interestingly, we uncovered both positive and negative effects on tolerance to other harsh environments for mutations in the different ergosterol genes, indicating that these beneficial mutations have effects that differ in sign among environmental challenges. These results demonstrate that although the genomic target was narrow, different adaptive mutations can lead populations down different evolutionary pathways, with respect to their ability to tolerate (or succumb to) other environmental challenges.},

abstract = {Flower longevity often exhibits a plastic response to pollination and may vary adaptively to maximize pollen removal and deposition and minimize flower maintenance costs. Using Chamerion angustifolium (fireweed), we experimentally tested two predictions that follow from this hypothesis: (1) flower closure should be triggered early, before fertilization, if it is to reduce costs and adjust to maximize pollen receipt; and (2) flower closure should respond differently to different kinds (outcross, self) and amounts (none, low, high) of pollen. In C. angustifolium, flower closure was initiated 4 h after pollination, well before any ovules were fertilized (25 h). The addition of pollen to stigmas significantly shortened the time to closure compared with unpollinated controls. Flower closure times were reduced with increasing pollen loads, up to 700 pollen grains, as might be expected if closure was adaptive. Flower closure was slower in self-pollinations than outcross pollinations at 24 and 48 h after pollination but not across the whole experiment. These results show that flower closure is highly plastic in fireweed and consistent with an adaptive response in that it promotes seed production and outcrossing over a range of pollination conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A useful DNA barcode requires sufficient sequence variation to distinguish between species and ease of application across a broad range of taxa. Discovery of a DNA barcode for land plants has been limited by intrinsically lower rates of sequence evolution in plant genomes than that observed in animals. This low rate has complicated the trade-off in finding a locus that is universal and readily sequenced and has sufficiently high sequence divergence at the species-level. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, a global plant DNA barcode system is evaluated by comparing universal application and degree of sequence divergence for nine putative barcode loci, including coding and non-coding regions, singly and in pairs across a phylogenetically diverse set of 48 genera (two species per genus). No single locus could discriminate among species in a pair in more than 79{\%} of genera, whereas discrimination increased to nearly 88{\%} when the non-coding trnH-psbA spacer was paired with one of three coding loci, including rbcL. In silico trials were conducted in which DNA sequences from GenBank were used to further evaluate the discriminatory power of a subset of these loci. These trials supported the earlier observation that trnH-psbA coupled with rbcL can correctly identify and discriminate among related species. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A combination of the non-coding trnH-psbA spacer region and a portion of the coding rbcL gene is recommended as a two-locus global land plant barcode that provides the necessary universality and species discrimination.},

abstract = {Most models of mating system evolution predict mixed mating to be unstable, although it is commonly reported from nature. Ecological interactions with mutualistic pollinators can help account for this discrepancy, but antagonists such as herbivores are also likely to play a role. In addition, inbreeding can alter ecological interactions and directly affect selfing rates, which may also contribute to maintaining mating system variation. We explored herbivore and inbreeding effects on pollinator behavior and selfing rates in Mimulus guttatus. First, individual spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius) herbivores were applied to native plants in two populations. Spittlebugs reduced flower size, increased anther-stigma distance, and increased selfing rates. A second experiment factorially crossed spittlebug treatment with inbreeding history (self- vs. cross-fertilized), using potted plants in arrays. Spittlebugs did not affect pollinator behavior, but they reduced flower size and nearly doubled the selfing rate. Inbreeding reduced the frequency of pollinator visits and increased flower-handling time, and this may be the first report that inbreeding affects pollinator behavior. Selfing rates of inbred plants were reduced by one half, which may reflect early inbreeding depression or altered pollinator behavior. The contrasting effects of herbivory and inbreeding on selfing rates may help maintain mating system variation in M. guttatus.},

Methods: Quantitative genetic field experiment over 2 years, genetic selection analyses, and measurement of five defensive traits (cardenolides, latex, trichomes, leaf toughness and nitrogen content). Results: All plant traits were genetically variable; directional selection favoured resistance to herbivory, latex production and the nitrogen content of leaves. Trichomes and latex were each negatively genetically correlated with abundances of herbivores, but not with herbivore damage; cardenolides and induced plant resistance were negatively genetically correlated with growth of monarchs. Conclusion: Selection for plant defence was influenced by: (1) genetic correlations in plant susceptibility to multiple herbivores; (2) resistance traits affecting some, but not all, aspects of the insect community; and (3) early season herbivory inducing changes in milkweed influencing later season herbivores.

abstract = {  Aim  Interest in species distribution models (SDMs) and related niche studies has increased dramatically in recent years, with several books and reviews being prepared since 2000. The earliest SDM studies are dealt with only briefly even in the books. Consequently, many researchers are unaware of when the first SDM software package (bioclim) was developed and how a broad range of applications using the package was explored within the first 8 years following its release. The purpose of this study is to clarify these early developments and initial applications, as well as to highlight bioclim's continuing relevance to current studies.    Location  Mainly Australia and New Zealand, but also some global applications.    Methods  We outline the development of the bioclim package, early applications (1984–1991) and its current relevance.    Results  bioclim was the first SDM package to be widely used. Early applications explored many of the possible uses of SDMs in conservation biogeography, such as quantifying the environmental niche of species, identifying areas where a species might be invasive, assisting conservation planning and assessing the likely impacts of climate change on species distributions.    Main conclusions  Understanding this pioneering work is worthwhile as bioclim was for many years one of the leading SDM packages and remains widely used. Climate interpolation methods developed for bioclim were used to create the WorldClim database, the most common source of climate data for SDM studies, and bioclim variables are used in about 76{\%} of recent published MaxEnt analyses of terrestrial ecosystems. Also, some of the bioclim studies from the late 1980s, such as measuring niche (both realized and fundamental) and assessing possible impacts of climate change, are still highly relevant to key conservation biogeography issues. },

abstract = {Reproductive isolation, which is essential for the maintenance of species in sympatry, is often incomplete between closely related species. In these taxa, reproductive barriers must continue to evolve within species, without being degraded by ongoing gene flow. To better understand this dynamic, we investigated the frequency and distribution of incompatibility alleles at a two-locus, recessive-recessive hybrid lethality system between species of yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus) that hybridize in nature. We found that M. guttatus typically carries hybrid lethality alleles at one locus (hl13) and M. nasutus typically carries hybrid lethality alleles at the other locus (hl14). As a result, most naturally formed hybrids will carry incompatible alleles at both loci, with the potential to express hybrid lethality in later generations. Despite this general pattern, we also discovered considerable polymorphism at both hl13 and hl14 within both Mimulus species. For M. guttatus, polymorphism at both loci even occurs within populations, meaning that incompatible allele pairings might also often arise through regular, intraspecific gene flow. By examining genetic variation linked to hl13 and hl14, we discovered that introgression from M. nasutus is a primary driver of this polymorphism within M. guttatus. Additionally, patterns of introgression at the two hybrid lethality loci suggest that natural selection acts to eliminate incompatible allele pairings, providing evidence that even weak reproductive barriers might promote genomic divergence between species.},

We found that prezygotic isolation was surprisingly strong: when given a choice, the majority of matings occurred between individuals from similar environments. Our results indicate that the by-product mechanism is a potent source of reproductive isolation, and likely contributed to the origin of sympatric species of sticklebacks.},

We measured the time lost to molt, based on growth rates in the surrounding stadia, of two insect herbivores. Molting from the penultimate to the final instar required a suprisingly long time in both species: 2.43 d in Epirritaa utumnata at 12?C (an average field temperature) and 3.58 d in Galerucellasa gittariae. This comprised 43{\%} and 50{\%} respectively of the total time in developing from the beginning of one instar to the beginning of the next. Epirrita molting time increased from 1.00 d at 24? to 8.27 d at 6?; Galerucella required 0.98 d at 24?and were unable to molt at 6?. Low temperaturers etardedt he development of molting larvae more than growing larvae. The geographic distribution of insects may be constrained by their ability to molt at low temperatures.},

abstract = {Physiological and ecological constraints play key roles in the evolution of plant growth patterns, especially in relation to defenses against herbivores. Phenotypic and life history theories are unified within the growth-differentiation balance (GDB) framework, forming an integrated system of theories explaining and predicting patterns of plant defense and competitive interactions in ecological and evolutionary time. Plant activity at the cellular level can be classified as growth (cell division and enlargement) of differentiation (chemical and morphological changes leading to cell maturation and specialization). The GDB hypothesis of plant defense is premised upon a physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes. The trade-off between growth and defense exists because secondary metabolism and structural reinforcement are physiologically constrained in dividing and enlarging cells, and because they divert resources from the production of new leaf area. Hence the dilemma of plants: They must grow fast enough to complete, yet maintain the defenses necessary to survive in the presence of pathogens and hervivores. The physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes interacts with herbivory and plant-plant competition to manifest itself as a genetic trade-off between growth and defense in the evolution of plant life history strategies. Evolutionary theories of plant defense are reviewed. We also extend a standard growth rate model by separating its ecological and evolutionary components,and formalizing the role of competition in the evolution of plant defense. We conclude with a conceptual model of the evolution of plant defense in which plant physioligical trade-offs interact with the abiotic environment, competition and herbivory.},

abstract = {Hybrid speciation is constrained by the homogenizing effects of gene flow from the parental species. In the absence of post-mating isolation due to structural changes in the genome, or temporal or spatial premating isolation, another form of reproductive isolation would be needed for homoploid hybrid speciation to occur. Here, we investigate the potential of behavioural mate choice to generate assortative mating among hybrids and parental species. We made three-first-generation hybrid crosses between different species of African cichlid fish. In three-way mate-choice experiments, we allowed hybrid and nonhybrid females to mate with either hybrid or nonhybrid males. We found that hybrids generally mated nonrandomly and that hybridization can lead to the expression of new combinations of traits and preferences that behaviourally isolate hybrids from both parental species. Specifically, we find that the phenotypic distinctiveness of hybrids predicts the symmetry and extent of their reproductive isolation. Our data suggest that behavioural mate choice among hybrids may facilitate the establishment of isolated hybrid populations, even in proximity to one or both parental species.},

Rates of seed germination and seedling growth were compared in two contrasting environments using diploid and tetraploid seeds of equal and also different biomass. Within each ploidy level, seed biomass had no effect on either the overall percentage nor the rate of germination. In contrast, the comparison of seeds of equal biomass but differing in ploidy level showed that seeds from tetraploid plants germinated faster and to a higher percentage than those from diploid plants. With respect to seedling growth, heavier seeds from the tetraploid genotypes gave seedlings of significantly higher biomass than those from lighter tetraploid and diploid seeds throughout the 2 months of study. Interestingly, seeds of equal biomass but from different ploidy levels produced seedlings more similar than those from the extreme seed weight categories. These differences were maintained in two different environmental conditions. These results suggest that there is a complex interdependance of seed size and ploidy on seed germination and seedling growth but is not a simple consequence of differences in seed size between diploids and their related tetraploids.Copyright 1995, 1999 Academic Press},

Post-emergence herbicides [(rimsulfuron + nicosulfuron) plus (dicamba + atrazine)] at four rates (full label rate (1 x), 75{\%} full rate (0.75 x), 50{\%}, full rate (0.5 x) and an untreated check) were tested at three corn row-spacings (38, 50, and 75 cm) and two plant densities (75 000 and 90 000 plants ha(-1)). Herbicide application at the 0.5x rate versus an untreated check still allowed for increased corn yield 8.3 vs. 4.9 t ha(-1)) and decreased weed dry weight (9.4 vs. 240.4 g m(-2)), weed plant density (11.0 vs. 52.6 plants m(-2)) and weed seed density (239 vs. 14241 seeds m(-2)). Corn LAI was not affected by decreasing herbicide rate. In this study, increasing corn plant density and decreasing corn row spacing were not factors in reducing herbicide inputs in corn cropping systems in central-southwestern Ontario. Herbicide rate could be reduced by up to 50{\%} while maintaining corn grain yield, weed density, weed dry weight, and the number of weed seeds entering into the soil seed bank. Implementation of these reduced rates will help to increase the economic and environmental sustainability of the Canadian Field corn industry.},

abstract = {The balance of selection acting through different fitness components (e.g. fecundity, mating success, survival) determines the potential tempo and trajectory of adaptive evolution. Yet the extent to which the temporal dynamics of phenotypic selection may vary among fitness components is poorly understood. Here, we compiled a database of 3978 linear selection coefficients from temporally replicated studies of selection in wild populations to address this question. Across studies, we find that multi-year selection through mating success and fecundity is stronger than selection through survival, but varies less in direction. We also report that selection through mating success varies more in long-term average strength than selection through either survival or fecundity. The consistency in direction and stronger long-term average strength of selection through mating success and fecundity suggests that selection through these fitness components should cause more persistent directional evolution relative to selection through survival. Similar patterns were apparent for the subset of studies that evaluated the temporal dynamics of selection on traits simultaneously using several different fitness components, but few such studies exist. Taken together, these results reveal key differences in the temporal dynamics of selection acting through different fitness components, but they also reveal important limitations in our understanding of how selection drives adaptive evolution.},

abstract = {In 1950, G. Ledyard Stebbins devoted two chapters of his book Variation and Evolution in Plants (Columbia Univ. Press, New York) to polyploidy, one on occurrence and nature and one on distribution and significance. Fifty years later, many of the questions Stebbins posed have not been answered, and many new questions have arisen. In this paper, we review some of the genetic attributes of polyploids that have been suggested to account for the tremendous success of polyploid plants. Based on a limited number of studies, we conclude: (i) Polyploids, both individuals and populations, generally maintain higher levels of heterozygosity than do their diploid progenitors. (ii) Polyploids exhibit less inbreeding depression than do their diploid parents and can therefore tolerate higher levels of selfing; polyploid ferns indeed have higher levels of selfing than do their diploid parents, but polyploid angiosperms do not differ in outcrossing rates from their diploid parents. (iii) Most polyploid species are polyphyletic, having formed recurrently from genetically different diploid parents. This mode of formation incorporates genetic diversity from multiple progenitor populations into the polyploid "species"; thus, genetic diversity in polyploid species is much higher than expected by models of polyploid formation involving a single origin. (iv) Genome rearrangement may be a common attribute of polyploids, based on evidence from genome in situ hybridization (GISH), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and chromosome mapping. (v) Several groups of plants may be ancient polyploids, with large regions of homologous DNA. These duplicated genes and genomes can undergo divergent evolution and evolve new functions. These genetic and genomic attributes of polyploids may have both biochemical and ecological benefits that contribute to the success of polyploids in nature.},

abstract = {Over the last two decades, the study of speciation has expanded from a modest backwater of evolutionary biology into a large and vigorous discipline. Thus, the literature on speciation, as well as the number of researchers and students working in this area, has grown explosively. Despite these developments, there has been no book-length treatment of speciation in many years. As a result, both the seasoned scholar and the newcomer to evolutionary biology had no ready guide to the recent literature on speciation-a body of work that is enormous, scattered, and increasingly technical. Although several excellent symposium volumes have recently appeared, these collections do not provide a unified, critical, and up-to-date overview of the field. Speciation is designed to fill this gap. Aimed at professional biologists, graduate students, and advanced undergraduates, Speciation covers both plants and animals (the first book on this subject to do so), and deals with all relevant areas of research, including biogeography, field work, systematics, theory, and genetic and molecular studies. It gives special emphasis to topics that are either controversial or the subject of active research, including sympatric speciation, reinforcement, the role of hybridization in speciation, the search for genes causing reproductive isolation, and mounting evidence for the role of natural and sexual selection in the origin of species. The authors do not hesitate to take stands on these and other controversial issues. This critical and scholarly book will be invaluable to researchers in evolutionary biology and is also ideal for a graduate-level course on speciation.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of global change and its impacts on biodiversity poses a clear and urgent challenge for evolutionary biologists. In many cases, environmental change is so widespread and rapid that individuals can neither accommodate to them physiologically nor migrate to a more favourable site. Extinction will ensue unless the population adapts fast enough to counter the rate of decline. According to theory, whether populations can be rescued by evolution depends upon several crucial variables: population size, the supply of genetic variation, and the degree of maladaptation to the new environment. Using techniques in experimental evolution we tested the conditions for evolutionary rescue (ER). Hundreds of yeast populations were exposed to normally lethal concentrations of salt in conditions, where the frequency of rescue mutations was estimated and population size was manipulated. In a striking match with theory, we show that ER is possible, and that the recovery of the population may occur within 25 generations. We observed a clear threshold in population size for ER whereby the ancestral population size must be sufficiently large to counter stochastic extinction and contain resistant individuals. These results demonstrate that rapid evolution is an important component of the response of small populations to environmental change.},

abstract = {Details on the genetics of behavioral and quantitative phenotypes remain limited to a few organisms. Such information is central to understanding both adaptation and speciation, as many of these phenotypes reduce gene flow between taxa [1–3]. Hybrid zones provide an ideal arena for studying this topic, as they consist of recombinant genotypes that allow genetic mapping of traits distinguishing natural populations [4]. We examined the genetic basis of migratory orientation and plumage color, both of which may contribute to speciation, in a hybrid zone between two groups of Swainson's thrushes that differ in these traits. We identified a cluster of SNPs on chromosome 4 strongly associated with migratory orientation. Genes involved with the circadian clock, nervous system, and cell signaling were located here and included candidates implicated in smaller-scale studies of migration in different animal groups, supporting previous suggestions that there is a common gene package for migration [5]. Plumage color was more polygenic than migratory orientation but showed strong associations on the Z chromosome that included SNPs linked to TYRP1, a gene involved in the production of eumelanin. We integrated these results with genomic data from pure populations and found that regions associated with both phenotypes co-localized with regions of elevated relative differentiation between the groups. This finding relates to the literature on islands of differentiation [6–8] by implicating divergent selection in generating these peaks. Together, our results identify specific genomic regions involved in both the regulation of complex phenotypes across animal groups and speciation [9].},

abstract = {The diversity of sexual signals is astounding, and divergence in these traits is believed to be associated with the early stages of speciation. An increasing number of studies also suggest a role for natural selection in driving signal divergence for effective transmission in heterogeneous environments. Both speciation and adaptive divergence, however, are contingent on the sexual signal being heritable, yet this often remains assumed and untested. It is particularly critical that the heritability of carotenoid-based sexual signals is investigated because such traits may instead be phenotypically plastic indicators of an individual's quality that exhibit no or little heritable variation. We present the first study to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the striking diversity of dewlap color and pattern in Anolis lizards. Using a breeding experiment with Anolis distichus populations exhibiting different dewlap phenotypes, we raise F1 offspring in a common garden experiment to assess whether dewlap color is inherited. We follow this with carotenoid supplementation to investigate the influence of dietary pigments to dewlap color variation. We find significant differences in several aspects of dewlap color and pattern to persist to the F1 generation (fathers: N = 19; F1 males: N = 50; P {\textless} 0.01) with no change in dewlap phenotype with carotenoid supplementation (N = 52; P {\textgreater} 0.05). These results strongly support that genetic differences underlie dewlap color variation, thereby satisfying a key requirement of natural selection. Our findings provide an important stepping-stone to understanding the evolution of an incredibly diverse signal important for sexual selection and species recognition.},

The regional center of origin for Lotus is probably the Mediterranean basin, where the greatest diversity of the species occurs. This complex genus has three basic chromosome numbers, 5, 6, and 7 (Angulo and Real 1977). The cytogenetic analysis of 108 species has been reported, including 25 tetraploids, 71 diploids, and 12 with both diploid and tetraploid cytotypes (Grant 1986). Most of the species can be classified as weeds; however, some, (e.g., Lotus corniculatus (4×), Lotus tenuis (2×) and Lotus uliginosus (2×) have attained important agronomic status. Of these Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil) is the most widely grown and the focus for the majority of the biotechnology research in the genus. Elucidation of the genetic origins of L. corniculatus has been the subject of debate for over a quarter of a century (Grant 1986). It is postulated that L. corniculatus arose through hybridization of L. uliginosus and L. alpinus and/or L. tenuis followed by chromosome doubling in the hybrid (Ross and Jones 1985), although this explanation may still be incomplete (Grant 1986).},

abstract = {Characterization of the phenotypic differentiation and genetic basis of traits that can contribute to reproductive isolation is an important avenue to understand the mechanisms of speciation. We quantified the degree of prezygotic isolation and geographical variation in mating behaviour among four populations of Sepsis neocynipsea that occur in allopatry, parapatry or sympatry with four populations of its sister species Sepsis cynipsea. To obtain insights into the quantitative genetic basis and the role of selection against hybrid phenotypes we also investigated mating behaviour of F1 hybrid offspring and corresponding backcrosses with the parental populations. Our study documents successful hybridization under laboratory conditions, with low copulation frequencies in heterospecific pairings but higher frequencies in pairings of F1 hybrids signifying hybrid vigour. Analyses of F1 offspring and their parental backcrosses provided little evidence for sexual selection against hybrids. Longer copulation latencies in heterospecific pairings indicate species recognition, probably due to surface or volatile chemicals. The frequency of male mating attempts did not differ greatly between species or hybrid pairings, suggesting no male discrimination of mating partners. Female shaking duration, signifying female choice and/or reluctance to mate, differed strongly between the species and appears to contribute to avoiding heterospecific males; this trait is partially maternal inherited. Importantly, females of both species discriminated more strongly against males in areas of sympatry than allopatry indicating reinforcement. Shorter copulations in heterospecific parental pairings and longer copulations in F1 hybrids suggest mechanistic difficulties with sperm transfer. Overall, our study highlights an important role of character displacement affecting mating behaviour of hybridizing sepsid species in geographical areas of coexistence.},

Emerging evidence shows that most species are declining as a result of human activities ('losers') and are being replaced by a much smaller number of expanding species that thrive in human-altered environments ('winners'). The result will be a more homogenized biosphere with lower diversity at regional and global scales. Recent data also indicate that the many losers and few winners tend to be non-randomly distributed among higher taxa and ecological groups, enhancing homogenization.},

abstract = {Large islands typically have more species than comparable smaller islands. Ecological theories, the most influential being the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, explain the species-area relationship as the outcome of the effect of area on immigration and extinction rates. However, these theories do not apply to taxa on land masses, including continents and large islands, that generate most of their species in situ. In this case, species-area relationships should be driven by higher speciation rates in larger areas, a theory that has never been quantitatively tested. Here we show that Anolis lizards on Caribbean islands meet several expectations of the evolutionary theory. Within-island speciation exceeds immigration as a source of new species on all islands larger than 3,000 km2, whereas speciation is rare on smaller islands. Above this threshold island size, the rate of species proliferation increases with island area, a process that results principally from the positive effects of area on speciation rate. Also as expected, the slope of the species-area relationship jumps sharply above the threshold. Although Anolis lizards have been present on large Caribbean islands for over 30 million years, there are indications that the current number of species still falls below the speciation-extinction equilibrium.},

While many researchers have focused on the role of pollinators and abiotic factors, far fewer have considered the enemy component of the environment. In this paper, I explore how herbivory may impact the evolution of dioecy from hermaphroditism through gyno- dioecy. This synthesis shows that the widespread occurrence of male-biased enemy attack in sexually dimorphic species is likely to have significant consequences for both the first and second steps in the evolution of dioecy through gynodioecy. I identify several ways that herbivory can influence sexual-system evolution, review the handful of studies that have explored them, and highlight exciting new avenues for research. From this review and synthesis, I conclude that consideration of enemies will provide a fresh dimension to our understanding of plant sexual systems.},

abstract = {Chromosome evolution in flowering plants is often punctuated by polyploidy, genome duplication events that fundamentally alter DNA content, chromosome number, and gene dosage. Polyploidy confers postzygotic reproductive isolation and is thought to drive ecological divergence and range expansion. The adaptive value of polyploidy, however, remains uncertain; ecologists have traditionally relied on observational methods that cannot distinguish effects of polyploidy per se from genic differences that accumulate after genome duplication. Here I use an experimental approach to test how polyploidy mediates ecological divergence in Achillea borealis (Asteraceae), a widespread tetraploid plant with localized hexaploid populations. In coastal California, tetraploids and hexaploids occupy mesic grassland and xeric dune habitats, respectively. Using field transplant experiments with wild-collected plants, I show that hexaploids have a fivefold fitness advantage over tetraploids in dune habitats. Parallel experiments with neohexaploids--first-generation mutants screened from a tetraploid genetic background--reveal that a 70{\%} fitness advantage is achieved via genome duplication per se. These results suggest that genome duplication transforms features of A. borealis in a manner that confers adaptation to a novel environment.},

abstract = {The importance of genetic interactions in the evolutionary process has been debated for more than half a century. Genetic interactions such as under dominance and epistasis (the interaction among genetic loci in their effects on phenotypes or fitness) can play a special role in the evolutionary process because they can create multiple fitness optima (adaptive peaks) separated by fitness minima (adaptive valleys). The valleys prevent deterministic evolution from one peak to another. We review the evidence that genetic interaction is a common phenomenon in natural populations. Some studies give strong circumstantial evidence for multiple fitness peaks, although the mapping of epistatic interactions onto fitness surfaces remains incompletely explored, and absolute proof that multiple peaks exist can be shown to be empirically impossible. We show that there are many reasons that epistatic polymorphism is very difficult to find, even when interactions are an extremely important part of the genetic system. When polymorphism results in the presence of multiple fitness peaks within a group of interbreeding populations, one fitness peak will quickly be nearly fixed within all interbreeding populations, but when epistatic or under dominant loci are nearly fixed, there will be no direct evidence of genetic interaction. Thus when complex landscapes are evolutionarily most important, evidence for alternative high fitness genetic combinations will be most ephemeral. Genetic interactions have been most clearly demonstrated in wide crosses within species and among closely related species. This evidence suggests that genetic interactions may play an important role in taxonomic diversification and species-level constraints. Population genetic analyses linked with new approaches in metabolic and molecular genetic research are likely to provide exciting new insights into the role of gene interactions in the evolutionary process.},

abstract = {One implication of Kacser's analysis of complex metabolic systems is that mutations with small effects exist as a consequence of the typically small flux control coefficient relating enzyme activity to the rate of a metabolic process. Although a slightly detrimental mutation is somewhat less likely to become fixed by chance than a slightly favorable mutation, mutations that are slightly detrimental might be expected to be more numerous than favorable mutations owing to the previous incorporation of favorable mutations by a long history of natural selection. The result is that, as Ohta has pointed out, a significant fraction of mutations that are fixed in evolution are slightly detrimental. In the long run, the fixation of detrimental mutations in a gene increases the opportunity for the occurrence of a compensatory favorable mutation, either in the same gene or in an interacting gene. On a suitably long timescale, therefore, every gene incorporates favorable mutations that compensate for detrimental mutations previously fixed. This form of evolution is driven primarily by natural selection, but it results in no change or permanent improvement in enzymatic function.},

abstract = {The field of DNA barcoding is working towards generating a genetic system for the quick and accurate identification of eukaryotic species. For the more systematic minded, however, DNA barcoding offers a new approach towards screening and uniting large numbers of biological specimens in genetic groups as a first step towards assigning them to species and genera in an approach best termed "molecular-assisted alpha taxonomy". This approach is particularly amenable in organisms with simple morphologies, a propensity for convergence, extensive phenotypic plasticity, and life histories with an alternation of heteromorphic generations. It is hard to imagine a group of organisms better defined by all of these traits than the marine macroalgae. In an effort to assess the utility of the DNA barcode (COI-5') for testing the current concepts of biodiversity of marine macroalgae in Canada, a study to assess species diversity in the red algal family, Dumontiaceae, was initiated. Through this work I confirm the presence in Canadian waters of Dilsea californica (J. Agardh) Kuntze, Dilsea integra (Kjellman) Rosenvinge, and Neodilsea borealis (I.A. Abbott) Lindstrom of the Dilsea-Neodilsea complex, and Weeksia coccinea (Harvey) Lindstrom for the genus Weeksia. However, our work has uncovered two additional species of the former complex, Dilsea lindstromiae Saunders sp. nov. and Dilsea pygmaea (Setchell) Setchell, and an additional species of the latter, Weeksia reticulata Setchell, effectively doubling representation of these foliose dumontiacean genera in Canadian waters},

We estimate the effective number of genetic factors that control differences in the cichlid head through a comprehensive morphological assessment of two Lake Malawi cichlid species and their F 1 and F 2 hybrid progeny. We estimate that between one and 11 factors underlie shape difference of individual bony elements. We show that many of the skeletal differences in the head and oral jaw apparatus are inherited together, suggesting a degree of pleiotropy in the genetic architecture of this character complex. Moreover, we find that cosegregation of shape differences in different elements corresponds to developmental, rather than functional, units.},

Because hybrid incompatibilities are caused by divergence in each of the hybridizing species, they also reveal genomic changes occurring on short evolutionary time scales that have functional consequences. These changes include divergence in protein-coding gene sequence, structure, and location, as well as divergence in noncoding DNAs. The most important unresolved issue is understanding the evolutionary causes of the divergence within species that in turn leads to incompatibility between species. Surprisingly, much of this divergence does not appear to be driven by ecological adaptation but may instead result from responses to purely mutational mechanisms or to internal genetic conflicts.},

Recent comparative studies have emphasized the possible importance of such correlated responses in affecting the evolution of traits, including some behaviors, which are of little adaptive significance, or even maladaptive. However, it is also possible for traits with major effects on fitness, such as brain size, to evolve entirely by correlated response. Other traits that do not appear to have evolved at all may have been subject to much directional selection, simply to prevent their evolution by correlated response. The new interest in correlated responses reflects more rigorous attempts to consider the organism as a whole, rather than dissecting it into a number of questionably separable traits.},

abstract = {Segregating hybrids often exhibit phenotypes that are extreme or novel relative to the parental lines. This phenomenon is referred to as transgressive segregation, and it provides a mechanism by which hybridization might contribute to adaptive evolution. Genetic studies indicate that transgressive segregation typically results from recombination between parental taxa that possess quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with antagonistic effects (i.e. QTLs with effects that are in the opposite direction to parental differences for those traits). To assess whether this genetic architecture is common, we tabulated the direction of allelic effects for 3252 QTLs from 749 traits and 96 studies. Most traits (63.6{\%}) had at least one antagonistic QTL, indicating that the genetic substrate for transgressive segregation is common. Plants had significantly more antagonistic QTLs than animals, which agrees with previous reports that transgressive segregation is more common in plants than in animals. Likewise, antagonistic QTLs were more frequent in intra- than in interspecific crosses and in morphological than in physiological traits. These results indicate that transgressive segregation provides a general mechanism for the production of extreme phenotypes at both above and below the species level and testify to the possible creative part of hybridization in adaptive evolution and speciation.},

The results indicate that sequence divergences at COI regularly enable the discrimination of closely allied species in all animal phyla except the Cnidaria.

We link population genetic processes of selection and adaptation to speciation and extinction by way of their interaction with environmental factors to drive global scale macro-ecological patterns. High latitude regions are both cradle and grave with respect to species diversification. In particular, we point to a conceptual equivalence of 'environmental harshness' and 'hard selection' as eco-evolutionary drivers of local adaptation and ecological speciation. By describing how ecological speciation likely occurs more readily at high latitudes, with such nascent species especially prone to extinction by fusion, we derive the ephemeral ecological speciation hypothesis as an integrative mechanistic explanation for latitudinal gradients in species turnover and the net accumulation of biodiversity.

We tested the consequences of experimental inbreeding on phenotypic plasticity in resistance and growth (tolerance) traits in Solanum carolinense (Solanaceae). Inbreeding reduced the ability of plants to up-regulate resistance traits following damage. Moreover, inbreeding disrupted growth trait responses to damage, indicating the presence of deleterious mutations at loci regulating growth under stress. Production of the phytohormones abscisic and indole acetic acid, and wounding-induced up-regulation of the defence signalling phytohormone jasmonic acid were all significantly reduced under inbreeding, indicating a phytohormonal basis for inbreeding effects on growth and defence trait regulation. We conclude that the plasticity of induced responses is negatively affected by inbreeding, with implications for fragmented populations facing mate limitation and stress as a consequence of environmental change.},

abstract = {Trace metals from anthropogenic activities are involved in numerous health impairments and may therefore select for detoxification mechanisms or a higher tolerance. Melanin, responsible for the black and red colourations of tegu- ments, plays a role in metal ion chelation and its synthesis is positively linked to immunity, antioxidant capacity and stress resistance due to pleiotropic effects. Therefore, we expected darker birds to (1) store higher amounts of metals in their feathers, (2) maintain lower metal concentrations in blood and (3) suffer less from metal exposure. We exposed feral pigeons (Columba livia) exhibiting various plumage darkness levels to low, but chronic, concentrations of zinc and/or lead, two of the most abundant metals in urban areas. First, we found negative and positive effects of lead and zinc, respectively, on birds' condition and reproductive parameters. Then, we observed positive relation- ships between plumage darkness and both zinc and lead concentrations in feathers. Interestingly, though darker adults did not maintain lower metal concentrations in blood and did not have higher fitness parameters, darker juveniles exhibited a higher survival rate than paler ones when exposed to lead. Our results show that melanin-based plumage colouration does modulate lead effects on birds' fitness parameters but that the relationship between metals, melanin, and fitness is more complex than expected and thus stress the need for more studies.},

abstract = {Human actiivties reduce biodiversity but may also drive diversification by modifying selection. Urbanization alters stream hydrology by increasing peak water belocities, which should in turn alter selection on the body morhpology of aquatic species. Here, we show how urbanization can generate evolutionary divergence in the body morphology of two species of stream fish, western blacknose dace (Rhinichthys obtusus) and creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus). we predicted that fish should evolve more streamlined body shapes within urbanized streams. We found that in urban streams, dace consistently exhibited more streamlined bodies while chub consistently showed deeper bodies. Comparing modern creek chub populations with historical museum collections psanning 50 years, we found that creekchub (1) rapidly became deeper-bodies in streams that experiened increasing urbanization over time, (2) had already achieved deepened bodies 50 years ago in streams that were then arleady urban (and showed no additional deepening over time), and (3) remained relatively shallow-bodied in streams that stayed rural over time. By raising creek chub from five populations under common conditions in the laboratory, we found that morphological differences largely reflected genetically-based differenced, not velocity-induced phenotypic plasticity. We suggest that urbanization can drive rapid, adaptive evolutionary responses to disturbance, and that these responses may vary unpredictably in different species.},

abstract = {Beetles in the genus Tetraopes share a long evolutionary history with milk- weeds (Asclepias spp.), feeding on roots as larvae and leaves as adults. Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10{\%} greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. This effect was caused by direct at- traction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally oviposits, I experi- mentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an indi- vidual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40{\%}, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20– 30{\%}, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23{\%} reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely al- leviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbi- vore. Many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes. Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse co- evolution between milkweed and its herbivores. I present a general model that predicts the conditions in which plant–plant interactions result in net competition or facilitation.},

We explored the importance of pollinator shifts in explaining floral divergence among 15 species of Iochroma. We examined four continuously varying floral traits: corolla length, nectar reward, display size, and flower color. Pollinator associations were characterized with a continuously varying measure of pollinator importance (the product of visitation and pollen deposition) for four groups of pollinators: hummingbirds, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. A phylogenetic generalized least squares approach was used to estimate correlations between pollinator groups and floral traits across a sample of Bayesian trees using different models of trait evolution. Multivariate analyses were also employed to identify suites of traits associated with each pollinator group. We found that nonphylogenetic models typically fit the data better than phylogenetic models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck), and thus results varied little across trees. Our results indicated that species with high nectar reward and large displays are significantly more likely to be pollinated by hummingbirds and less likely to be pollinated by all groups of insects. Corolla length and flower color did not show any consistently significant associations with pollinator groups. For these two traits, we discuss alternative evolutionary forces, including phylogenetic inertia and community-level factors.},

abstract = {Evolutionary rescue occurs when a population genetically adapts to a new stressful environment that would otherwise cause its extinction. Forecasting the probability of persistence under stress, including emergence of drug resistance as a special case of interest, requires experimentally validated quantitative predictions. Here, we propose general analytical predictions, based on diffusion approximations, for the probability of evolutionary rescue. We assume a narrow genetic basis for adaptation to stress, as is often the case for drug resistance. First, we extend the rescue model of Orr {\&} Unckless (Am. Nat. 2008 172, 160-169) to a broader demographic and genetic context, allowing the model to apply to empirical systems with variation among mutation effects on demography, overlapping generations and bottlenecks, all common features of microbial populations. Second, we confront our predictions of rescue probability with two datasets from experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (bacterium). The tests show the qualitative agreement between the model and observed patterns, and illustrate how biologically relevant quantities, such as the per capita rate of rescue, can be estimated from fits of empirical data. Finally, we use the results of the model to suggest further, more quantitative, tests of evolutionary rescue theory.},

abstract = {Genetically correlated traits do not evolve independently, and the covariances between traits affect the rate at which a population adapts to a specified selection regime. To measure the impact of genetic covariances on the rate of adaptation, we compare the rate fitness increases given the observed G matrix to the expected rate if all the covariances in the G matrix are set to zero. Using data from the literature, we estimate the effect of genetic covariances in real populations. We find no net tendency for covariances to constrain the rate of adaptation, though the quality and heterogeneity of the data limit the certainty of this result. There are some examples in which covariances strongly constrain the rate of adaptation but these are balanced by counter examples in which covariances facilitate the rate of adaptation; in many cases, covariances have little or no effect. We also discuss how our metric can be used to identify traits or suites of traits whose genetic covariances to other traits have a particularly large impact on the rate of adaptation.},

Here we use putatively neutral microsatellite loci to study if and how genetic variation can be partitioned in a hierarchical way among different urbanization classes. Principal coordinate analyses did not support the hypothesis that urban/suburban and rural populations comprise two distinct genetic clusters. Comparison of FST values at different hierarchical scales revealed drift as an important force of population differentiation. Redundancy analyses revealed that genetic structure was strongly affected by both spatial variation and level of urbanization. The results shown here can be used as baseline information for future genetic monitoring programmes and provide additional insights into contemporary house sparrow dynamics along urbanization gradients.},

The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

A general mechanism by which this occurs is ecological speciation, defined as the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations as a result of ecologically-based divergent natural selection. The alternative mechanism is mutation-order speciation in which populations fix different mutations as they adapt to similar selection pressures. Although numerous cases now indicate the importance of ecological speciation in nature, very little is known about the genetics of the process. Here, we summarize the genetics of premating and postzygotic isolation and the role of standing genetic variation in ecological speciation. We discuss the role of selection from standing genetic variation in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a complex of species whose ancestral marine form repeatedly colonized and adapted to freshwater environments. We propose that ecological speciation has occurred multiple times in parallel in this group via a "transporter" process in which selection in freshwater environments repeatedly acts on standing genetic variation that is maintained in marine populations by export of freshwater-adapted alleles from elsewhere in the range. Selection from standing genetic variation is likely to play a large role in ecological speciation, which may partly account for its rapidity.},

abstract = {Senecio cambrensis is one of a few allopolyploid plant species known to have originated in the recent past and, therefore, provides excellent material for analysing allopolyploid speciation. This allohexaploid species originated in the UK within the last 100 years following hybridization between diploid S. squalidus and tetraploid S. vulgaris. In this chapter, we first describe the events leading up to hybridization between these two species, focusing mainly on the origin and spread of S. squalidus in the UK. We then consider alternative pathways by which S. cambrensis might have originated and conclude that current evidence suggests an origin via formation of the triploid hybrid (S. x baxteri) followed by chromosome doubling. We next review our investigations into levels of genetic diversity and also changes to gene expression and the possible causes of this (epigenetic effects) during the origin of S. cambrensis. High levels of genetic diversity, assessed by surveys of allozyme and AFLP variation, have been recorded in S. cambrensis, and it is likely that intergenomic recombination was an important generator of this diversity. Our studies of `resynthesized' S. cambrensis have shown that the initial genome merger (hybridization) producing S. x baxteri generates genome-wide, non-additive alterations to parental patterns of gene expression and DNA methylation, with genome duplication resulting in a secondary burst of both transcriptional and epigenetic modification. In synthetic allohexaploid lines of S. cambrensis phenotypic changes become apparent from the second to fifth generations, possibly as a consequence of recombination or epigenetic effects; these include changes in ray flower form and emergence of self-incompatible individuals. We conclude by considering the future of S. cambrensis from the standpoint of it being a model species for further study of allopolyploid speciation, and second its long-term success in the wild. Ongoing work to produce a draft reference genome for S. squalidus will underpin future research in S. cambrensis, enabling a more thorough survey of changes to DNA methylation, small RNA activity and promoter binding in the hybrids, as well as comparison with the related allotetraploid S. eboracensis to determine the effects of genome dosage. The future of the species in the wild is currently uncertain. The population in Edinburgh that represented a separate origin of the species in the wild during the 1970s is now extinct, and there has been a marked decline in the number of populations and individuals of the species in its heartland, North Wales, since the 1980s. An analysis of how its ecology compares with those of its parents is lacking. However, it appears to share the same habitats in the wild with its parents, which might have contributed to its decline. Although S. cambrensis may become extinct in the wild in the near future, the potential will remain for it to originate again in the UK providing that conditions prevail for its parents to hybridize.},

abstract = {Abstract: Natural hybridization threatens a substantial number of plant and animal species with extinction, but extinction risk has been difficult to evaluate in the absence of a quantitative assessment of risk factors. We investigated a number of ecological parameters likely to affect extinction risk, through an individual-based model simulating the life cycle of two hybridizing annual plant species. All parameters tested, ranging from population size to variance in pollen-tube growth rates, affected extinction risk. The sensitivity of each parameter varied dramatically across parameter sets, but, overall, the competitive ability, initial frequency, and selfing rate of the native taxon had the strongest effect on extinction. In addition, prezygotic reproductive barriers had a stronger influence on extinction rates than did postzygotic barriers. A stable hybrid zone was possible only when habitat differentiation was included in the model. When there was no habitat differentiation, either one of the parental species or the hybrids eventually displaced the other two taxa. The simulations demonstrated that hybridization is perhaps the most rapidly acting genetic threat to endangered species, with extinction often taking place in less than five generations. The simulation model was also applied to naturally hybridizing species pairs for which considerable genetic and ecological information is available. The predictions from these ?worked examples? are in close agreement with observed outcomes and further suggest that an endemic cordgrass species is threatened by hybridization. These simulations provide guidance concerning the kinds of data required to evaluate extinction risk and possible conservation strategies.; Resumen: La hibridaci{\'{o}}n natural amenaza de extinci{\'{o}}n a numerosas especies de plantas y animales.

Hakusan, Japan, Plantago asiatica, an alien plant, and Plantago hakusanensis, a native alpine species, grow sympatrically along with their putative hybrids. Here, their flowering behavior, which affects the frequency of hybridization and the colonizing ability of P. asiatica and its hybrids, is described. The flowering behavior of each species and of two F1 hybrids from different seed parents was determined based on the position of the flower in the inflorescence by using a generalized linear mixed model. The percentage fruit set of individually bagged inflorescences was calculated to corroborate the assumptions of the opportunities for self-pollination. All the flowers were protogynous; however, many P. asiatica anthers dehisced before browning of the stigma in the flower and the sex presentations in the inflorescence were asynchronous. The percentage of fruit set was high. Consequently, P. asiatica has the opportunity for self-pollination within the flower and in the inflorescence. In contrast, the P. hakusanensis anthers dehisced after browning of the stigma in the flower; their sex presentation was synchronous in the inflorescence, showing negligible opportunities for self-pollination, and the fruit set was low. Accordingly, in the field, P. hakusanensis might require pollination among the inflorescences for seed production and be actively outcrossed, while P. asiatica is able to outcross in the early flowering phase. Therefore, P. asiatica and P. hakusanensis have opportunities for hybridization. The F1 hybrids exhibited intermediate flowering behavior and produced fruits, demonstrating the potential to reproduce by selfing.},

abstract = {Humans affect biodiversity at the genetic, species, community, and ecosystem levels. This impact on genetic diversity is critical, because genetic diversity is the raw material of evolutionary change, including adaptation and speciation. Two forces affecting genetic variation are genetic drift (which decreases genetic variation within but increases genetic differentiation among local populations) and gene flow (which increases variation within but decreases differentiation among local populations). Humans activities often augment drift and diminish gene flow for many species, which reduces genetic variation in local populations and prevents the spread of adaptive complexes outside their population of origin, thereby disrupting adaptive processes both locally and globally within a species. These impacts are illustrated with collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) in the Missouri Ozarks. Forest fire suppression has reduced habitat and disrupted gene flow in this lizard, thereby altering the balance toward drift and away from gene flow. This balance can be restored by managed landscape burns. Some have argued that, although human-induced fragmentation disrupts adaptation, it will also ultimately produce new species through founder effects. However, population genetic theory and experiments predict that most fragmentation events caused by human activities will facilitate not speciation, but local extinction. Founder events have played an important role in the macroevolution of certain groups, but only when ecological opportunities are expanding rather than contracting. The general impact of human activities on genetic diversity disrupts or diminishes the capacity for adaptation, speciation, and macroevolutionary change. This impact will ultimately diminish biodiversity at all levels.},

The inflorescence of tetraploids had a more ovate and thicker spathum, a more cylindrical spadix and a thicker but shorter flower stalk. Biomass production of the tetraploids was reduced, as expressed by lower total dry weights, and tetraploids produced fewer shoots and leaves compared with their diploid progenitors. Furthermore, tetraploid Spathiphyllum plants were more resistant to drought stress compared with diploid plants. After 15 days of drought stress, diploids showed symptoms of wilting, while the tetraploids showed almost no symptoms. Further, measurements of stomatal resistance, leaf water potential, relative water content and proline content indicated that the tetraploid genotypes were more resistant to drought stress compared with the diploids.},

abstract = {Sterility barriers, ranging from incomplete to fully developed, were recently demonstrated within taxonomic species of the genus Draba, suggesting the existence of numerous, cryptic biological species. Because these taxa are predominately selfers and of Pleistocene origin, it was concluded that hybrid sterility evolved quickly and possibly by genetic drift. Here we used genetic mapping and QTL analyses to determine the genetic basis of hybrid sterility between geographically distant populations of one of these taxonomic species, Draba nivalis. Fifty microsatellite loci were mapped, and QTL analyses identified five loci underlying seed fertility and two underlying pollen fertility. Four of five seed fertility QTLs reduced fertility in heterozygotes, an observation most consistent with drift-based fixation of underdominant sterility loci. However, several nuclear-nuclear interactions were also found, including two that acted like reciprocal translocations with lowest fitness in double heterozygotes, and two that had a pattern of fitness consistent with Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities. In contrast, pollen fertility QTLs exhibited additive inheritance, with lowest fertility associated with the paternal allele, a pattern of inheritance suggestive of cytonuclear incompatibilities. The results imply that multiple genetic mechanisms underlie the rapid evolution of reproductive barriers in Draba.},

abstract = {Transition of an evolving population to a new adaptive optimum is predicted to leave a signature in the distribution of effect sizes of fixed mutations. If they affect many traits (are pleiotropic), large effect mutations should contribute more when a population evolves to a farther adaptive peak than to a nearer peak. We tested this prediction in wild threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) by comparing the estimated frequency of large effect genetic changes underlying evolution as the same ancestor adapted to two lake types since the end of the ice age. A higher frequency of large effect genetic changes (quantitative trait loci) contributed to adaptive evolution in populations that adapted to lakes representing a more distant optimum than to lakes in which the optimum phenotype was nearer to the ancestral state. Our results also indicate that pleiotropy, not just optimum overshoot, contributes to this difference. These results suggest that a series of adaptive improvements to a new environment leaves a detectable mark in the genome of wild populations. Although not all assumptions of the theory are likely met in natural systems, the prediction may be robust enough to the complexities of natural environments to be useful when forecasting adaptive responses to large environmental changes.},

abstract = {An adaptive role of corolla shape has been often asserted without an empirical demonstration of how natural selection acts on this trait. In generalist plants, in which flowers are visited by diverse pollinator fauna that commonly vary spatially, detecting pollinator-mediated selection on corolla shape is even more difficult. In this study, we explore the mechanisms promoting selection on corolla shape in the generalist crucifer Erysimum mediohispanicum Polatschek (Brassicaceae). We found that the main pollinators of E. mediohispanicum (large bees, small bees and bee flies) discriminate between different corolla shapes when offered artificial flowers without reward. Importantly, different pollinators prefer different shapes: bees prefer flowers with narrow petals, whereas bee flies prefer flowers with rounded overlapping petals. We also found that flowers with narrow petals (those preferred by bees) produce both more pollen and nectar than those with rounded petals. Finally, different plant populations were visited by different faunas. As a result, we found spatial variation in the selection acting on corolla shape. Selection favoured flowers with narrow petals in the populations where large or small bees are the most abundant pollinator groups. Our study suggests that pollinators, by preferring flowers with high reward, exert strong selection on the E. mediohispanicum corolla shape. The geographical variation in the pollinator-mediated selection on E. mediohispanicum corolla shape suggests that phenotypic evolution and diversification can occur in this complex floral trait even without specialization.},

abstract = {1. Herbivory can induce resistance in a plant and the induced phenotype may be disfavoured by subsequent herbivores. Yet, as the distance between plants in a population increases, limited mobility may make a herbivore more likely to feed and oviposit on host plants in its immediate surroundings. 2. The present study tested whether a herbivore's preference and distribution across plants with different induced phenotypes was influenced by the spatial distribution of plants. A fragmented population of Solanum dulcamara plants was created. This consisted of discrete, spatially separated patches with different histories of damage, either herbivory from adult flea beetles (Psylliodes affinis), tortoise beetles (Plagiometriona clavata), or mechanical damage. Each patch was separated by 7 m and consisted of 12 plants that were spaced 30 cm apart. Then a fixed number of adult tortoise beetles were introduced to each patch, and movement and oviposition within and between spatially separate homogeneous patches (receiving one type of damage) were compared with movement and oviposition within heterogeneous patches (containing all three types of damage) over the growing season. 3. Flea beetle and tortoise beetle herbivory consistently induced different phytochemical responses in S. dulcamara (polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase), and adult tortoise beetles avoided oviposition on the flea beetle induced plants within heterogeneous patches. However, between homogeneous patches, plant phenotype did not influence oviposition. Colonisation by naturally occurring flea beetle adults followed a similar pattern. 4. These results suggest that the heterogeneity of plant phenotypes can influence herbivore choice and distribution at small but not large spatial scales.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular basis of how new species arise is a central question and prime challenge in evolutionary biology and includes understanding how genomes diversify. Eukaryotic cells possess an integrated compartmentalized genetic system of endosymbiotic ancestry. The cellular subgenomes in nucleus, mitochondria and plastids communicate in a complex way and co-evolve. The application of hybrid and cybrid technologies, most notably those involving interspecific exchanges of plastid and nuclear genomes, has uncovered a multitude of species-specific nucleo-organelle interactions. Such interactions can result in plastome-genome incompatibilities, which can phenotypically often be recognized as hybrid bleaching, hybrid variegation or disturbance of the sexual phase. The plastid genome, because of its relatively low number of genes, can serve as a valuable tool to investigate the origin of these incompatibilities. In this article, we review progress on understanding how plastome-genome co-evolution contributes to speciation. We genetically classify incompatible phenotypes into four categories. We also summarize genetic, physiological and environmental influence and other possible selection forces acting on plastid-nuclear co-evolution and compare taxa providing molecular access to the underlying loci. It appears that plastome-genome incompatibility can establish hybridization barriers, comparable to the Dobzhansky-Muller model of speciation processes. Evidence suggests that the plastid-mediated hybridization barriers associated with hybrid bleaching primarily arise through modification of components in regulatory networks, rather than of complex, multisubunit structures themselves that are frequent targets.},

abstract = {Ecological specialization is widely recognized as a major determinant of the emergence and maintenance of biodiversity. We studied two critical facets of specialization – local adaptation and habitat choice – in the host races of the leaf beetle Lochmaea capreae on willow and birch. Our results revealed that there is asymmetric disruptive selection for host use traits, and host races achieved different adaptive sets of life history traits through association with their host plant. Beetles from each host race exhibited food and oviposition preference for their own host plant. Reciprocal transplant displayed significant variation in host acceptance and performance: all families from the willow race rejected the alternative host plant before initiation of feeding and all died on this host plant. By contrast, all families from the birch race accepted willow for feeding, but they consumed less and performed less well. Intriguingly, families that performed well on birch also performed well on willow, suggesting positive genetic correlation rather than genetic trade-offs. Our results suggest that the major proximal determinant of host specialization in the willow race is the behavioural acceptance of a plant rather than the toxicity of the food resource. However, in the birch race a combination of behavioural host acceptance and performance may play a role in specialization. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms by which divergent host adaptation might influence the evolution of reproductive isolation between herbivorous populations.},

The MA recognizes that interactions exist between people, biodiversity, and ecosystems. That is, changing human conditions drive, both directly and indirectly, changes in biodiversity, changes in ecosystems, and ultimately changes in the services ecosystems provide. Thus biodiversity and human well-being are inextricably linked.

abstract = {1. Hybridization is common in natural plant populations. Trait expression and ecological performance of hybrids determine the consequences of hybridization such as the degree and direction of gene flow or the generation of phenotypic novelty. 2. We investigated responses to shade and drought stress in crosses within the naturally hybridizing campions Silene dioica and S. latifolia and reciprocal crosses between them. We collected data on fitness proxies and on leaf and root traits in a 2-year greenhouse experiment. 3. Responses to drought stress did not differ between cross types. Shade stress, in contrast, led to a reduced flowering incidence in S. dioica but not in S. latifolia. Rapid flowering under stress conditions in S. latifolia could be an adaptation to disturbance in its habitat, whereas a delay of reproduction might be adaptive in the more predictable environment of S. dioica. 4. Hybrids exhibited intermediate, parental-like and transgressive trait expression. Both hybrid cross types were similar to S. latifolia in terms of biomass production possibly because of dominance of S. latifolia alleles or heterosis. Hybrids further had a strongly reduced flowering incidence under shade stress as did S. dioica, suggesting dominance of S. dioica alleles for flower induction. Under shade stress, both hybrid cross types produced much larger leaves than either of the two species suggesting that epigenetic interactions are disturbed. Reciprocal hybrids did not differ in fitness; however, maternal effects were observed for root cross-sectional area and mass per male flower, possibly supporting asymmetric gene flow in natural populations. 5. Synthesis. Silene latifolia and S. dioica responded to stress with differences in life history rather than in growth. Our results further suggest that different modes of gene action are responsible for the specific combination of intermediate, parental-like and transgressive traits observed in first-generation hybrids that may limit their performance and thus gene flow between the species.},

abstract = {Hybrids between related species vary widely in relative fitness, and that fitness can depend upon the environment. We investigated aspects of physiology that might influence fitness patterns in a plant hybrid zone. Seeds of Ipomopsis aggregata, I. tenuituba, F1 hybrids, F2 hybrids, and offspring of crosses between natural hybrids were planted into the relatively mesic site of origin for I. aggregata and the drier site for natural hybrids. We measured rates of photosynthesis (A max), transpiration (E), instantaneous (A/E) and long-term ($\delta$13C) indices of water use efficiency (WUE), and leaf nitrogen and carbon. We also examined correlations of these traits with plant size. Photosynthetic rate and A/E were higher in vegetative than flowering plants. WUE varied between sites and years, but differences among genotypic classes were spatially and temporally consistent. Instantaneous WUE was higher for F1 hybrids than for the average of the parental species, thereby showing heterosis. There was no evidence of hybrid breakdown, as WUE was no different in the F2 than the average across the F1 and parental species. Nor did WUE depend on cross direction in producing F1 progeny. Carbon isotope discrimination revealed higher long-term water use efficiency in I. tenuituba than I. aggregata. Leaf nitrogen was higher in I. tenuituba than I. aggregata, and higher in offspring of natural hybrids than in the F2. Results indicate heterosis for water use efficiency, with no hybrid breakdown. Heterosis in WUE may help to explain the relatively high survival of both reciprocal F1 hybrids in dry sites within the natural hybrid zone.},

abstract = {Acoustic communication is fundamental in avian territory defence and mate attraction. In urban environments where sound transmissions are more likely to be masked by low-frequency anthropogenic noise, acoustic adaptations may be advantageous. However, minor modifications to a signal could affect its efficacy. While recent research has shown that there is divergence between songs from noisy and quiet areas, it is unknown whether these differences affect the response to the signal by its receivers. Here, we show that there is a difference in spectral aspects of rural and urban song in a common passerine, the great tit Parus major, at 20 sites across the UK. We also provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that such environmentally induced differences in song influence the response of male territory holders. Males from quiet territories exhibited a significantly stronger response when hearing song from another territory holder with low background noise than from those with high background noise. The opposite distinction in response intensity to homotypic versus heterotypic song was observed in males from noisy territories. This behavioural difference may intensify further signal divergence between urban and rural populations and raises important questions concerning signal evolution.},

abstract = {Understanding speciation requires the identification of traits that cause reproductive isolation. This remains a major challenge since it is difficult to determine which of the many divergent traits actually caused speciation. To overcome this difficulty, we studied the sexual cue traits and behaviors associated with rapid speciation between EA and WN sympatric behavioral races of Drosophila athabasca that diverged only 16,000-20,000 years ago. First, we found that sexual isolation was essentially complete and driven primarily by divergent female mating preferences. To determine the target of female mate choice, we found that, unlike cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), male courtship song is highly divergent between EA and WN in both allopatry and sympatry and is not affected by latitudinal variation. We then used pheromone rub-off experiments to show no effect of CHCs on divergent female mate choice. In contrast, both male song differences and male mating success in hybrids exhibited a large X-effect and playback song experiments confirmed that male courtship song is indeed the target of sexual isolation. These results show that a single secondary sexual trait is a major driver of speciation and suggest that we may be overestimating the number of traits involved in speciation when we study older taxa.},

The strength and directionality of this barrier to gene flow depends on the genetic architecture underlying divergence in ecologically relevant phenotypes. We here present line cross analyses of inheritance for two key foraging-related morphological traits involved in adaptive divergence between stickleback ecotypes residing parapatrically in lake and stream habitats within the Misty Lake watershed (Vancouver Island, Canada). One main finding is the striking genetic dominance of the lake phenotype for body depth. Selection associated with this phenotype against first- and later-generation hybrids should therefore be asymmetric, hindering introgression from the lake to the stream population but not vice versa. Another main finding is that divergence in gill raker number is inherited additively and should therefore contribute symmetrically to reproductive isolation. Our study suggests that traits involved in adaptation might contribute to reproductive isolation qualitatively differently, depending on their mode of inheritance.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Polyploidy resulting from whole genome duplication has contributed to the adaptive evolution of many plant species. However, the conditions necessary for successful polyploid evolution and subsequent establishment and persistence in sympatry with diploid progenitors are often quite limited. One condition thought to be necessary for establishment is a substantial competitive superiority of the polyploid.

METHODS: We conducted a pairwise competition experiment using diploid and tetraploid cytotypes of Centaurea stoebe L. to determine whether (1) tetraploids have greater competitive ability than diploids, (2) cytotypes from mixed-cytotype populations have more balanced competitive abilities than single-cytotype populations, and (3) competitive abilities change along a longitudinal gradient.

KEY RESULTS: Across sampling localities, tetraploids did not produce greater aboveground biomass than diploids but suffered from greater intracytotypic competition. Tetraploids allocated greater biomass belowground than diploids, regardless of competition treatment, and had greater performance for traits associated with long-term persistence (bolted more frequently and produced more accessory rosettes). Competitive ability of tetraploids did not differ between single- and mixed-cytotype populations but varied along a longitudinal gradient. Tetraploids were stronger intercytotypic competitors in Western Europe (Switzerland and Germany) than in Eastern Europe (Hungary and Slovakia), which indicates that cytotype coexistence may be more likely in Eastern Europe, the proposed origin of tetraploids, than in Western Europe.

CONCLUSIONS: Our study addresses the importance of examining competitive interactions between cytotypes across their distributional range, as competitive interactions were not consistent across sampling localities.},

It is more likely that both morphological and molecular data will be simultaneously analyzed, developing what has been coined as "integrative taxonomy".
