# pleiotropy-test

This is a GitHub repository associated with the manuscript provisonally titled: *Evidence that pleiotropic alleles underlie adaptive divergence between natural populations*. Biorxiv info to come.

The aim of this article was to test a prediction of Fisher's geometric model of adaptation (and other models with pleiotropy) that adaptive divergence between populations gives rise deterministically to transgressive segregation variance in recombinant hybrids.

The manuscript files, data, simulations (python) and analysis scripts (R) are all located herein. To run the simulations, take a look at the readme in the simulations folder. To run the R scripts, best to open the the .Rproj file in RStudio and it should all work from there except for saving files because the current script saves to an Overleaf directory.
